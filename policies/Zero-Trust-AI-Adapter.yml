# Auto-generated by SYREN PolicyGPT

policy:
  version: "1.0"
  name: "Zero-Trust-AI-Adapter"
  description: |
    This policy defines the Zero Trust principles for AI systems, ensuring that all access is verified, 
    regardless of the origin of the request. The Zero Trust AI Adapter applies microsegmentation, access control, 
    and continuous monitoring to safeguard AI systems from unauthorized access, data leaks, and malicious activities.

  scope:
    - AI Models
    - Data Storage
    - User Access
    - Communication Channels

  zero_trust_principles:
    - "Never Trust, Always Verify"
    - "Verify Explicitly"
    - "Use Least Privilege Access"
    - "Assume Breach and Contain"
  
  ai_system_security_controls:
    - access_control:
        description: |
          All requests to AI models and systems will undergo strict identity verification and authorization.
        actions:
          - Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all access points.
          - Use role-based access control (RBAC) for AI system resources.
          - Implement attribute-based access control (ABAC) for dynamic access decisions based on context and risk.
          
    - microsegmentation:
        description: |
          Microsegmentation is implemented to limit lateral movement within the network and isolate critical AI resources.
        actions:
          - Segment AI models into isolated zones based on sensitivity and risk.
          - Use network policies to enforce separation between low-risk and high-risk AI resources.
          
    - continuous_monitoring:
        description: |
          Continuous monitoring of AI system activities to detect abnormal behaviors and unauthorized access attempts.
        actions:
          - Implement anomaly detection algorithms to monitor AI interactions.
          - Use machine learning models to detect and respond to potential security threats in real-time.
          
    - data_encryption:
        description: |
          All AI data is encrypted in transit and at rest to ensure data confidentiality and integrity.
        actions:
          - Enforce end-to-end encryption for data exchanged between AI systems and external sources.
          - Use strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256) for data at rest.
          
    - auditing_and_logging:
        description: |
          All access to AI models and data must be logged and audited regularly for compliance and security analysis.
        actions:
          - Enable logging of all user interactions with AI systems, including access attempts, changes, and model outputs.
          - Ensure logs are immutable and stored securely for audit purposes.
          
  enforcement:
    - policies:
        description: |
          All AI systems must implement Zero Trust access policies, including MFA, least privilege, and real-time monitoring.
        actions:
          - Policy enforcement will be automated through security agents on all AI models and data storage systems.
          - Any deviation from policy will trigger immediate alerts for investigation.
    
    - incident_response:
        description: |
          The Zero Trust AI Adapter includes an incident response strategy that assumes breaches will occur.
        actions:
          - In the event of a detected breach, isolate affected AI models or data immediately.
          - Automatically apply containment measures to prevent further data exfiltration or model compromise.
          - Trigger alerting and automated remediation workflows for security teams.
