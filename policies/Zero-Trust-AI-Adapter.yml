version: 1.1

modules:
  - name: "Continuous Auth AI"
    action: "Biometric + behavior analysis"
    compliance: "NIST 800-207"
    description: |
      Continuous authentication leveraging biometric data and behavioral analytics.
      This module ensures that every access request is validated throughout the user session, not just at the login stage. It uses AI to detect any abnormal behavior in real-time, providing continuous validation of users and devices.
    recommendation: |
      For enhanced security, pair continuous authentication with contextual risk analysis to assess access request legitimacy based on user location, device health, and behavior.
    use_case: |
      Ideal for environments with high-value assets, where unauthorized access attempts need to be blocked immediately, and continuous validation is critical.

  - name: "Microsegmentation NLP"
    action: "Auto-generate network rules from natural language"
    input: "Sales DB needs 1-way isolation from HR API"
    compliance: "NIST 800-207, ISO 27001"
    description: |
      Leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically generate network segmentation rules based on business context. This module ensures that communication between sensitive data systems and external systems is tightly controlled, enhancing internal network security.
    recommendation: |
      Regularly review and update the rules generated by this module to ensure alignment with evolving organizational requirements and new threat vectors.
    use_case: |
      This module is crucial in environments where network segmentation policies are complex and need frequent updates based on business requirements. It helps prevent lateral movement by attackers inside the network.

  - name: "AI-Powered Access Control"
    action: "Risk-based adaptive access"
    compliance: "NIST 800-53, ISO 27001"
    description: |
      AI-driven dynamic access control decisions based on real-time risk assessment. This module uses machine learning to assess the risk associated with each access request, considering user context, threat intelligence, and historical access patterns.
    recommendation: |
      Implement this module to dynamically adapt access policies as per the risk level, ensuring that critical systems are only accessed by authorized individuals with the appropriate clearance.
    use_case: |
      In critical environments such as finance or government, where the sensitivity of data and systems require fine-tuned access controls, AI-powered access control can help in providing more granular control.

  - name: "Behavioral Anomaly Detection"
    action: "Monitor user and device behavior"
    compliance: "ISO 27001, NIST 800-53"
    description: |
      Continuously monitors user and device behavior across the network. Uses machine learning to identify deviations from established behavioral patterns, such as unusual login times, geolocation, or access to sensitive systems.
    recommendation: |
      To maximize the effectiveness, pair this module with real-time alerting and auto-incident response features to immediately neutralize potential threats.
    use_case: |
      Ideal for environments with large-scale user interaction, where insider threats or advanced persistent threats (APTs) may go unnoticed by traditional security controls.

  - name: "Automated Policy Enforcement"
    action: "Enforce dynamic policies based on AI insights"
    compliance: "NIST 800-53, CIS Controls"
    description: |
      AI-powered enforcement of security policies, ensuring that the organizationâ€™s security posture remains consistent across all assets. This module automatically applies security controls based on continuous threat intelligence and context, such as enforcing stronger encryption for high-risk data or limiting access to specific systems.
    recommendation: |
      Set up automated remediation actions for policy violations, ensuring that the security framework adapts to emerging threats without requiring manual intervention.
    use_case: |
      Particularly useful in compliance-heavy industries (e.g., finance, healthcare) where maintaining strict policy adherence is mandatory for both security and regulatory requirements.

  - name: "Zero-Trust AI Insights Dashboard"
    action: "Real-time visibility and analytics"
    compliance: "ISO 27001, NIST 800-53"
    description: |
      A real-time analytics and visibility dashboard that uses AI to provide a comprehensive view of the organization's security posture. It visualizes network access, identifies trends, and flags potential weaknesses in real-time, helping SOC teams to proactively identify and mitigate threats.
    recommendation: |
      Use this dashboard to monitor policy enforcement, threat trends, and anomalous activities across the entire organization, enabling faster incident response and proactive risk management.
    use_case: |
      Ideal for executive leadership and SOC teams who need real-time insights to drive informed decisions, allowing for a quicker response to emerging risks.
