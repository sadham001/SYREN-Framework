# 04 - Identity and Access Management Policy

*Auto-generated by SYREN PolicyGPT*

## 1. Purpose
This policy outlines the principles and controls for identity and access management (IAM) within SYREN’s AI-driven cybersecurity framework. It ensures that only authorized users and systems have access to sensitive data and AI models while maintaining strict access controls and accountability.

## 2. Scope
This policy applies to all users, systems, and AI services within SYREN’s infrastructure that require access to sensitive resources, including AI models, threat detection systems, and data repositories. It covers both internal and external users, including employees, contractors, third-party partners, and automated systems.

## 3. Identity Management Principles
SYREN follows the following principles for managing identities within the organization:

- **Unique User Identification**: Every user and system must have a unique identifier to ensure accountability.
- **Least Privilege**: Users and systems are granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their job functions.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Access is granted based on the roles assigned to users, ensuring that only individuals with appropriate roles have access to specific systems and data.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: MFA is required for accessing sensitive systems and data to add an extra layer of security.
- **Regular Access Reviews**: Access rights are reviewed periodically to ensure they are still appropriate for each user and role.

## 4. Access Control Management
SYREN implements the following access control strategies:

- **Authentication**: Users must authenticate using secure methods, including usernames, passwords, and MFA. Authentication protocols must meet industry standards (e.g., OAuth, OpenID).
- **Authorization**: After successful authentication, users are granted access based on their roles and permissions within SYREN’s infrastructure.
- **Access Logging**: All access requests, both successful and unsuccessful, are logged and monitored. Logs are retained for a minimum of one year for auditing and security analysis.
- **Access Revocation**: Access to systems and data is immediately revoked upon a user’s departure, role change, or request for termination. Access revocation is tracked and audited.

## 5. Identity Lifecycle Management
SYREN’s IAM policy includes the following identity lifecycle management processes:

- **Provisioning**: New users are provisioned with appropriate access rights based on their role and responsibilities within the organization.
- **Modification**: Users’ access rights are adjusted based on changes to their role, responsibilities, or needs.
- **Deactivation**: When a user leaves or changes roles, their access is deactivated in a timely manner to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Reactivation**: In rare cases, user accounts may be reactivated following an appropriate review and approval process.

## 6. Privileged Access Management (PAM)
Privileged accounts have elevated access to critical systems and data. The following measures are implemented for PAM:

- **Access Limitation**: Only authorized personnel are granted privileged access to critical systems.
- **Privilege Escalation Monitoring**: Any elevation of privileges is monitored and logged.
- **Session Recording**: Privileged sessions, such as administrative access to AI models or sensitive systems, are recorded for audit and compliance purposes.
- **Periodic Audits**: Privileged access is audited regularly to ensure it is being used appropriately and in compliance with organizational policies.

## 7. Access Control Policies for AI Systems
Access control for AI systems follows the same principles outlined in this policy, with additional safeguards for critical AI-driven components, including:

- **AI Model Access**: Only authorized personnel are permitted to train, modify, or deploy AI models. Access to models is restricted based on roles and responsibilities.
- **Data Access**: Access to data used for training AI models is tightly controlled. Sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information (PII), is protected through encryption and access restrictions.
- **AI System Integration**: Third-party AI systems or APIs integrated into SYREN’s infrastructure must adhere to the same access control policies and undergo security reviews before being granted access to internal systems.

## 8. Compliance and Audit
SYREN ensures compliance with the following standards for identity and access management:

| Control Area                | ISO 27001   | NIST 800-53   | GDPR           |
|-----------------------------|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| Access Control Framework     | A.9.1.1     | AC-1          | Art. 32        |
| User Authentication          | A.9.2.1     | IA-5          | Art. 25        |
| Privileged Access Management | A.9.4.2     | AC-6          | Art. 32        |
| Access Logging               | A.12.4.1    | AU-2          | Art. 33        |

## 9. Review Cycle
- **Owner**: Identity and Access Management Officer (IAMO)
- **Review Frequency**: Annually, or whenever there are significant changes to the access control policies or regulatory requirements.
