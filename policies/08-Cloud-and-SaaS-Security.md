# 08 - Cloud and SaaS Security Policy

*Auto-generated by SYREN PolicyGPT*

## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for securing cloud-based environments and Software as a Service (SaaS) applications used by SYREN. It aims to ensure that cloud infrastructure, services, and data are protected against potential threats, ensuring compliance with global security standards and protecting organizational assets.

## 2. Scope
This policy applies to all cloud and SaaS applications utilized by SYREN, including those that are hosted by third-party providers. It covers cloud-based storage, processing, SaaS applications, and any third-party services integrated with SYREN’s systems, across all global regions where SYREN operates.

## 3. Cloud and SaaS Security Principles
SYREN adheres to the following key security principles for cloud and SaaS environments:

- **Data Protection**: All data stored in cloud environments must be encrypted at rest and in transit. Access controls must be implemented to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- **Access Control**: Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies must be enforced to ensure that only authorized users and systems can access cloud services and data.
- **Compliance**: Cloud and SaaS services must comply with applicable international and industry-specific regulations such as GDPR, ISO 27001, HIPAA, and SOC 2.
- **Shared Responsibility Model**: Clearly define the responsibilities between SYREN and the cloud service provider for securing infrastructure, applications, and data.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement continuous monitoring to detect and respond to security incidents, threats, and vulnerabilities in cloud and SaaS environments.

## 4. Cloud and SaaS Risk Management
To manage risks associated with cloud and SaaS, SYREN implements the following strategies:

- **Risk Assessment**: Perform regular risk assessments of cloud services to identify potential vulnerabilities, ensuring that appropriate mitigation actions are taken before deployment.
- **Data Classification**: Classify data based on sensitivity and implement appropriate controls for each classification. Sensitive data must be stored in secure, compliant cloud environments.
- **Third-party Vendor Management**: Evaluate third-party vendors based on their security posture and ensure they meet SYREN’s security requirements before integrating their services.

## 5. Security Controls for Cloud Services
SYREN mandates the following security controls for all cloud and SaaS environments:

- **Encryption**: Ensure end-to-end encryption for data stored in the cloud, as well as for data in transit between services.
- **Access Control and IAM**: Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for access to cloud resources and ensure least-privilege access for users, services, and applications.
- **Security Logging**: Enable detailed logging of all activities in the cloud environment for auditing and investigation purposes. Logs must be securely stored and monitored for suspicious activities.
- **Network Segmentation**: Implement network segmentation to minimize the risk of lateral movement in the event of a breach, using firewalls, micro-segmentation, and VPNs.
- **Incident Response**: Develop and implement an incident response plan for cloud and SaaS environments, including coordination with cloud providers for effective resolution.

## 6. Cloud Service Provider Management
When selecting cloud service providers (CSPs), SYREN requires the following criteria:

- **Security Certifications**: The CSP must hold relevant security certifications (e.g., ISO 27001, SOC 2, GDPR, etc.) to demonstrate their commitment to security best practices.
- **Service-Level Agreements (SLAs)**: Ensure SLAs are in place with the cloud provider to outline the security commitments, including availability, performance, and incident response timelines.
- **Data Ownership**: SYREN retains ownership of all data stored in the cloud. The CSP must not access, share, or store SYREN’s data without explicit authorization.

## 7. SaaS Application Security
SYREN follows these guidelines for securing SaaS applications:

- **Vendor Security Reviews**: Perform security assessments of SaaS providers before adopting their services, ensuring they meet SYREN’s security and compliance requirements.
- **Data Integration**: Ensure secure integration of SaaS applications with SYREN’s internal systems using secure APIs and data transfer methods.
- **User Access Control**: Implement strict access controls for SaaS applications, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access sensitive data and configurations.
- **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular audits of the SaaS applications to ensure compliance with SYREN’s security standards and policies.

## 8. Compliance and Regulatory Alignment
SYREN’s Cloud and SaaS Security policy aligns with various global compliance standards and frameworks:

| Control Area                | ISO 27001   | NIST 800-53  | GDPR           |
|-----------------------------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| Cloud Data Protection        | A.18.1.4    | SC-28        | Art. 32        |
| Access Control               | A.9.2.1     | AC-2         | Art. 25        |
| Third-party Security         | A.15.1.1    | SA-9         | Art. 28        |
| Encryption and Data Privacy  | A.10.1.1    | SC-13        | Art. 5         |
| Incident Response and Logging| A.16.1.4    | IR-4         | Art. 33        |

## 9. Reporting and Monitoring
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement continuous monitoring to detect unauthorized access, anomalous behavior, and potential security breaches in cloud and SaaS environments.
- **Incident Reporting**: Any security incidents or data breaches involving cloud or SaaS services must be reported immediately to the Security Operations Center (SOC) and logged in the incident management system.
- **Compliance Audits**: Regular audits must be performed to assess compliance with security policies and regulatory requirements for cloud and SaaS services.

## 10. Review Cycle
- **Owner**: Cloud Security Manager
- **Review Frequency**: Annually or after any major changes in cloud services, SaaS providers, or security regulations.
