# SYREN AI Risk Management Policy  
*Auto-generated by SYREN PolicyGPT*

### **1. Purpose**  
The purpose of this AI Risk Management Policy is to ensure the continuous and automated assessment of AI-driven risks across SYREN's cybersecurity framework. This policy defines the approach to risk identification, evaluation, mitigation, and monitoring, leveraging SYREN's advanced AI capabilities.

### **2. Scope**  
This policy applies to all AI-driven processes, systems, and modules within SYREN, including but not limited to threat prediction, continuous risk monitoring, and policy enforcement. The policy covers all assets monitored by SYREN across cloud, on-premise, and hybrid environments.

### **3. AI Risk Categories**  
SYREN classifies AI risks into the following categories:

- **Model Risk**: The potential for AI models to produce inaccurate, biased, or faulty predictions or decisions.
- **Data Risk**: Risks associated with the quality, integrity, and security of data used by AI systems.
- **Operational Risk**: Risks stemming from the integration and deployment of AI in operational environments, including performance degradation, system failures, or unintended consequences.
- **Ethical Risk**: Risks related to fairness, transparency, and accountability in AI-driven decisions.

### **4. AI Risk Rules & Mitigation**  
SYREN employs a risk-based approach to AI management, categorizing risks based on severity and impact. The following rules apply:

- **Critical Risk (Score ≥90%)**: 
  - **Action**: Immediate isolation of affected assets, system lock-down.
  - **Mitigation**: Trigger automated remediation processes, alert the Security Operations Center (SOC) for immediate investigation.
  
- **High Risk (70-89%)**: 
  - **Action**: Temporary restrictions on affected assets or AI models.
  - **Mitigation**: Human review initiated, escalate for further investigation, log for future analysis.

- **Medium Risk (50-69%)**: 
  - **Action**: Regular monitoring and logging for future review.
  - **Mitigation**: Scheduled re-assessment and model re-training to mitigate identified risk.

- **Low Risk (<50%)**: 
  - **Action**: Continue regular operations with periodic AI model updates.
  - **Mitigation**: Ongoing assessment and updates to the model as new data emerges.

### **5. Risk Mitigation Strategy**  
SYREN implements the following strategies to reduce AI-related risks:

- **AI Transparency & Explainability**: 
  - Ensure that AI-driven decisions are transparent and explainable to stakeholders. This allows users to understand the reasoning behind automated actions, increasing trust and confidence in AI decisions.
  
- **Bias Detection & Correction**: 
  - Use AI fairness tools to detect and mitigate bias in models, ensuring that AI decisions are equitable and free from unintended prejudices.

- **Model Validation & Testing**: 
  - Continuously test and validate AI models against real-world scenarios to ensure their accuracy and reliability. Regular updates are applied to improve model performance over time.

- **Data Quality Management**: 
  - Ensure that data used for training AI models is clean, accurate, and up to date. Implement automatic data validation mechanisms to prevent low-quality or malicious data from impacting the model’s performance.

### **6. Compliance Mapping**  
SYREN’s AI risk management strategy aligns with various international cybersecurity frameworks and compliance standards, including:

| SYREN AI Risk Management Control   | ISO 27001 Control | NIST 800-53 Control | GDPR Compliance |  
|------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------|  
| Automated Risk Detection & Response | A.12.6.1          | SI-4                | Art. 33         |  
| Continuous AI Model Evaluation     | A.12.2.1          | CA-7                | Art. 25         |  
| Data Integrity & Security          | A.8.2.2           | AC-2                | Art. 5          |  
| AI Ethics & Transparency           | A.6.1.2           | PM-9                | Art. 22         |  

### **7. Risk Monitoring & Reporting**

- **Continuous Risk Monitoring**: AI systems continuously monitor assets for any signs of risk or abnormal behavior. These systems generate real-time risk assessments that are reported back to the SOC.
- **Reporting Structure**: AI risk reports are generated on a weekly basis and are accessible to both the cybersecurity team and upper management. These reports provide a detailed analysis of identified risks, mitigation steps taken, and future actions needed.
  
- **Example of an AI Risk Report:**

| **Risk Category**   | **High Risk**                         |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Affected Module**  | Continuous Auth AI                    |
| **Risk Score**       | 85%                                   |
| **Risk Description** | The AI model detected abnormal behavior patterns that might indicate unauthorized access attempts. |
| **Mitigation Steps** | Temporary restrictions applied. SOC alerted for further investigation. |
| **Future Actions**   | Manual review and model update scheduled. |

### **8. AI Risk Review & Continuous Improvement**  
To ensure ongoing effectiveness, SYREN’s AI Risk Management policy undergoes a quarterly review. This review includes:

- **AI Model Audits**: A comprehensive audit of all active AI models to ensure their continued relevance and effectiveness.
- **Risk Adjustment**: Adjustments to risk thresholds, mitigation strategies, and AI models based on emerging trends, feedback, and changes in the threat landscape.
- **Ethical Reviews**: Regular reviews of AI decisions for ethical implications, ensuring compliance with regulatory and ethical standards.

### **9. Conclusion**  
SYREN's AI Risk Management Policy ensures that all AI-driven processes within the organization are continuously monitored, assessed, and updated to minimize risk and improve operational efficiency. Through automation, transparency, and proactive risk mitigation, SYREN ensures that AI is a trusted and secure tool for modern cybersecurity.
