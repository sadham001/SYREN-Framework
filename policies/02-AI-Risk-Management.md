# 02 - AI Risk Management Policy

*Auto-generated by SYREN PolicyGPT*

## 1. Purpose
To ensure the continuous and automated identification, evaluation, mitigation, and monitoring of AI-driven risks within the SYREN cybersecurity framework.

## 2. Scope
Applies to all AI models, data pipelines, systems, and users interacting with SYREN’s AI features across cloud, on-premises, and hybrid environments.

## 3. AI Risk Categories
SYREN classifies AI-related risks into:

- **Model Risk**: Inaccurate or biased outputs.
- **Data Risk**: Issues with data integrity, poisoning, or quality.
- **Operational Risk**: Failures in deployment or unintended AI behavior.
- **Ethical Risk**: Lack of fairness, explainability, or transparency.

## 4. Risk Scoring and Thresholds

| Risk Level    | Score Range | Actions                                                                 |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Critical      | ≥ 90%       | Auto-isolation, alert SOC, execute containment scripts.                |
| High          | 70–89%      | Limit access, initiate human review, log for audit.                    |
| Medium        | 50–69%      | Monitor, schedule re-training, evaluate manually if escalated.         |
| Low           | < 50%       | Standard operations, passive monitoring.                               |

## 5. Mitigation Framework
- **Explainability Layer**: Every flagged AI decision must include an explainable log.
- **Bias Detection Pipelines**: Triggered weekly to analyze fairness metrics.
- **Model Stress Testing**: Simulate edge-case inputs and adversarial patterns monthly.
- **SOC Integration**: All critical and high risks are pushed to the Security Operations Center (SOC) dashboard.

## 6. Sample Risk Report Format
```markdown
**Risk Category**: High Risk  
**Affected Module**: Continuous Auth AI  
**Risk Score**: 85%  
**Risk Description**: The AI model detected abnormal behavior patterns that might indicate unauthorized access attempts.  
**Mitigation Steps**: Temporary restrictions applied. SOC alerted for further investigation.  
**Future Actions**: Manual review and model update scheduled.

## 7. Compliance Alignment

| Control Area                    | ISO 27001   | NIST 800-53   | GDPR         |
|----------------------------------|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| AI Risk Monitoring               | A.12.6.1    | RA-5, SI-4    | Art. 33      |
| Model Testing & Validation       | A.14.2.8    | SA-11         | Art. 25      |
| Bias/Fairness & Explainability   | A.6.1.2     | PM-9          | Art. 22      |

## 8. Review Cycle
- **Owner**: Chief AI Risk Officer (CAIRO)
- **Review Frequency**: Quarterly or post-incident
