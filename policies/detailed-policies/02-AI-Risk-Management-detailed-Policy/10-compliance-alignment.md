# 10.0 Compliance Alignment

Ensuring alignment with relevant laws, regulations, and standards is a foundational aspect of AI risk management. Compliance safeguards organizational integrity, protects user rights, and reduces exposure to legal and reputational risks associated with AI technologies.

## 10.1 Purpose

The purpose of this section is to define how AI risk management activities are aligned with applicable compliance requirements, including international frameworks, sector-specific standards, and jurisdictional laws.

## 10.2 Applicable Frameworks and Regulations

SYREN’s AI Risk Management Framework should align with the following, where applicable:

- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**  
  Covers data protection, transparency, and user consent for AI models using personal data.

- **EU Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA)**  
  Establishes risk classifications, prohibited use cases, and governance rules for high-risk AI systems.

- **ISO/IEC 23894 (AI Risk Management)**  
  Standard for AI-specific risk identification, evaluation, and treatment practices.

- **ISO/IEC 27001 / 27701**  
  Information security and privacy information management system standards.

- **National & Local Regulations**  
  Such as CCPA (California), PDPA (Singapore), DIFC DP Law (UAE), or sectoral laws like HIPAA for healthcare AI.

- **Industry Best Practices**  
  NIST AI RMF, OECD AI Principles, and G7/G20 AI governance guidelines.

## 10.3 Compliance Mapping and Gap Analysis

To ensure alignment, organizations should regularly conduct:

- **Compliance Mapping**:  
  Map internal AI practices and policies to each applicable regulation and framework.

- **Gap Analysis**:  
  Identify deviations or missing controls and initiate remediation actions.

- **Documented Evidence**:  
  Maintain auditable records of compliance efforts, decisions, and risk mitigation steps.

## 10.4 Controls for High-Risk Use Cases

Specific compliance actions should be enforced for high-risk AI systems, including:

- Explicit user consent for automated decision-making
- Human-in-the-loop validation
- Impact assessments (e.g., DPIAs)
- Explainability and auditability of model decisions
- Monitoring for discriminatory or biased outputs

## 10.5 Accountability Structures

| Role                  | Compliance Responsibility                              |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Protection Officer (DPO) | Oversight of personal data usage in AI          |
| AI Ethics Committee    | Policy review and ethical compliance                    |
| Legal & Compliance     | Interpret regulatory requirements and drive implementation |
| Risk Management Team   | Monitor alignment and flag violations                   |

## 10.6 Continuous Monitoring and Updates

AI compliance is not static — laws and frameworks evolve quickly. SYREN mandates:

- **Quarterly Compliance Reviews**: Evaluate adherence to changing laws.
- **Regulatory Watch**: Monitor global developments in AI legislation.
- **Policy Updates**: Revise internal standards and controls accordingly.
- **Employee Re-training**: Update staff awareness as new requirements emerge.

## 10.7 Reporting and Audit Readiness

- Maintain traceability of AI decisions and risk assessments.
- Log interactions, decisions, and data sources in a tamper-proof format.
- Prepare for internal and external audits through structured documentation.

## 10.8 Enforcement and Consequences

Failure to comply with applicable laws can lead to:

- Financial penalties and sanctions
- Suspension or prohibition of AI systems
- Loss of customer trust
- Legal action and reputational harm

Non-compliance should be escalated to senior leadership and addressed with urgency.

## 10.9 Conclusion

Regulatory alignment is more than a checkbox — it's a core pillar of responsible AI. Through proactive compliance management, organizations protect users, avoid penalties, and enable ethical innovation. SYREN ensures that every layer of AI risk management is grounded in legal and regulatory accountability.
