# 11.0 Review Cycle

AI risk management is not a one-time activity. A structured and continuous review cycle ensures that risks are dynamically identified, reassessed, and addressed in light of emerging threats, model changes, and regulatory developments.

## 11.1 Purpose

This section outlines the periodic review mechanisms that ensure the AI risk management framework remains effective, up-to-date, and responsive to internal and external changes.

## 11.2 Review Types

SYREN mandates three levels of AI risk reviews:

### 11.2.1 Periodic Reviews

Conducted at regular intervals (e.g., quarterly, bi-annually, annually) to evaluate the entire AI risk posture.

- **Quarterly**: For high-risk AI systems or those under regulatory scrutiny.
- **Bi-annually**: For moderate-risk AI tools.
- **Annually**: For low-risk and stable AI systems.

### 11.2.2 Triggered Reviews

Initiated upon:

- Significant changes to AI model architecture or data
- Introduction of new AI use cases or features
- Detection of incidents or anomalies
- Regulatory updates or legal rulings
- Vendor or third-party model integrations

### 11.2.3 Post-Incident Reviews

Conducted after:

- Security breaches
- Operational failures
- Regulatory violations
- Ethical or fairness complaints

Outcomes are documented and used to enhance both risk treatment plans and governance structures.

## 11.3 Roles and Responsibilities

| Role                    | Review Responsibility                                   |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Risk Manager            | Oversees the review calendar and coordinates updates    |
| Data Scientists         | Provide model updates and performance evaluations       |
| Compliance Officer      | Validates legal/regulatory alignment                    |
| Ethics Committee        | Assesses fairness, bias, and transparency implications  |
| Security Team           | Evaluates security posture of AI pipelines              |

## 11.4 Review Scope

Each review cycle should evaluate:

- Current risk register status
- Changes in AI models, data, or logic
- Effectiveness of risk mitigation measures
- Alignment with latest compliance mandates
- Model performance and drift
- User feedback or stakeholder concerns

## 11.5 Documentation and Version Control

Every review cycle must result in:

- An updated **Risk Register**
- Revised **Risk Treatment Plans** (if needed)
- **Versioned** documentation of models and configurations
- Meeting minutes and decisions archived for audit

## 11.6 Continuous Improvement

The review cycle enables continuous improvement by:

- Identifying inefficiencies in mitigation strategies
- Refining policies and guidelines
- Adapting controls to new threats
- Enhancing employee awareness and training
- Embedding feedback into model development lifecycle

## 11.7 Technology Enablement

Use of AI governance platforms or risk management tools is recommended for:

- Automated review scheduling
- Versioning and audit trails
- Dashboard-based risk heatmaps
- Notifications on due or overdue reviews

## 11.8 Conclusion

A robust review cycle is the cornerstone of adaptive AI risk management. SYRENâ€™s commitment to scheduled and triggered reviews ensures AI systems remain secure, compliant, ethical, and aligned with evolving operational needs and legal expectations.
