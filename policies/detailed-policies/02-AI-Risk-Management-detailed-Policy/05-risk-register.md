# 05 - Risk Register

## 1.0 Introduction

The Risk Register is a centralized repository used to record, track, and manage all identified AI-related risks throughout the system lifecycle. It enables transparency, accountability, and effective decision-making by providing a structured and up-to-date view of the AI risk landscape.

The register serves as a living document, updated regularly as new risks emerge or existing ones evolve due to changes in systems, business context, or regulations.

---

## 2.0 Purpose and Objectives

The Risk Register aims to:

- Provide a structured overview of all risks associated with AI systems.
- Track the status, treatment, and ownership of each risk.
- Support prioritization and resource allocation decisions.
- Ensure regulatory and compliance obligations are met.
- Serve as an audit trail for internal governance and external regulators.

## 3.0 Structure of the Risk Register

Each entry in the Risk Register must follow a consistent structure to ensure clarity, accountability, and traceability.

### 3.1 Required Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Risk ID** | A unique identifier for tracking the risk. |
| **Date Identified** | The date the risk was first logged. |
| **Risk Description** | A concise but detailed explanation of the risk. |
| **Risk Category** | Classification (e.g., operational, privacy, ethical, legal, bias, cybersecurity). |
| **Likelihood Rating** | Assessed likelihood of occurrence (scale 1–5). |
| **Impact Rating** | Assessed severity of consequences (scale 1–5). |
| **Risk Score** | Calculated score based on likelihood × impact. |
| **Risk Level** | Categorized level: Low, Medium, High, Critical. |
| **Treatment Strategy** | Chosen response: Avoid, Reduce, Transfer, Accept. |
| **Treatment Plan Summary** | Brief description of mitigation or control measures. |
| **Responsible Party** | Role/team accountable for addressing the risk. |
| **Status** | Current risk state: Open, Mitigated, Closed, Monitoring. |
| **Residual Risk** | Assessment of remaining risk post-treatment. |
| **Review Date** | Last and next review dates. |
| **Notes/Comments** | Additional context, updates, or decisions. |

### 3.2 Example Entry

Residual Risk: Moderate  
Review Date: 2025-04-15  
Notes: Pending outcome of fairness audit.  
```
## 4.0 Risk Ownership and Responsibility

Each risk recorded in the Risk Register must be assigned a designated owner to ensure proper accountability, monitoring, and follow-up actions. Clear assignment of responsibility ensures that risks are actively managed and do not fall through governance gaps.

### 4.1 Roles and Responsibilities

- **Risk Owner**:  
  Responsible for overseeing the risk from identification to closure, ensuring timely updates and communication to stakeholders.

- **System Owner**:  
  Accountable for implementing the technical or procedural changes necessary to mitigate or manage the risk.

- **Compliance and Legal Teams**:  
  Ensure that the treatment strategy aligns with applicable regulatory frameworks (e.g., GDPR, ISO 27001, NIST AI RMF).

- **AI Governance Committee**:  
  Provides strategic direction, validates high-impact decisions, and approves residual risk levels for high and critical risks.

## 5.0 Lifecycle of a Risk Entry

Each risk recorded in the register passes through a structured lifecycle consisting of the following stages:

1. **Identification** – Risk is identified via assessment, audits, incident reports, or external changes.
2. **Documentation** – Risk is logged into the register with all required metadata.
3. **Assessment** – Likelihood and impact are evaluated, and the overall risk score is calculated.
4. **Treatment Planning** – Treatment strategy is selected and the plan is developed with stakeholders.
5. **Execution** – Mitigation actions are implemented by responsible teams.
6. **Monitoring and Re-evaluation** – Risk is reviewed periodically to ensure effective treatment.
7. **Closure** – Risk is marked closed if fully mitigated or accepted if risk tolerance criteria are met.

---

## 6.0 Review and Update Protocol

To maintain its relevance, the Risk Register must be reviewed and updated regularly. Each risk should be revisited at intervals based on its severity and organizational risk appetite.

### 6.1 Frequency of Reviews

| Risk Level | Minimum Review Frequency |
|------------|--------------------------|
| Critical   | Quarterly                |
| High       | Semi-annually            |
| Medium     | Annually                 |
| Low        | Every two years          |

### 6.2 Trigger Events for Ad-Hoc Review

- Deployment of a new or updated AI model
- Change in organizational strategy or risk appetite
- Change in legal or regulatory frameworks
- Post-incident investigation findings
- Discovery of new technical vulnerabilities or ethical concerns

---

## 7.0 Integration with Risk Assessment and Treatment

The Risk Register is tightly coupled with both the Risk Assessment and Risk Treatment processes:

- **Input from Assessment**:  
  Risk identification and evaluation from assessments flow directly into the register.

- **Output to Treatment**:  
  Treatment strategies, including responsibility and timelines, are documented and tracked through the register.

- **Continuous Feedback Loop**:  
  As risks evolve, updated assessments and treatment strategies are recorded, forming a closed-loop governance process.

---

## 8.0 Compliance and Auditing

A well-maintained Risk Register also supports compliance with internal policies and external regulatory requirements.

- **Audit Trail**:  
  Every risk entry should include a history of updates, decisions made, and review notes to support internal and external audits.

- **Data Retention**:  
  Risk records should be archived securely for a minimum period (e.g., 5–7 years), depending on jurisdiction and industry.

- **Accessibility**:  
  Role-based access controls should be enforced to allow transparency without compromising data sensitivity.

- **Alignment**:  
  The register should align with industry best practices and standards such as ISO 31000, NIST RMF, ISO 23894, and the OECD AI Principles.

Organizations may choose between manual and automated solutions to maintain the register, depending on scale and complexity.

### 9.1 Tool Options

- **Spreadsheets**:  
  Suitable for smaller organizations or pilot programs.

- **GRC Platforms**:  
  Provide automation, collaboration, version control, and advanced reporting.

- **AI Risk Management Tools**:  
  Specialized platforms designed for dynamic AI environments with integrations into MLOps, CI/CD, and data pipelines.
