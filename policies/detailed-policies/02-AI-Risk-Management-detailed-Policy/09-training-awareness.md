- **Executive Leadership**  
  Understand the strategic and regulatory implications of AI risks and their role in governance and oversight.

- **Risk Management Teams**  
  Gain detailed knowledge of AI risk identification, assessment, and treatment techniques.

- **Developers & Engineers**  
  Focused training on ethical design, secure coding practices, data quality management, and model explainability.

- **Operations & IT Teams**  
  Training on AI integration risks, system monitoring, performance baselines, and anomaly detection.

## 9.5 Evaluation and Effectiveness

To ensure the training remains relevant and impactful, periodic evaluations should be conducted:

- **Feedback Surveys**: Gather participant insights and adjust materials accordingly.
- **Knowledge Checks**: Use quizzes or scenario-based assessments to evaluate understanding.
- **Metrics and KPIs**:
  - % of employees trained
  - Average training scores
  - Training completion rate
  - Post-training behavior improvements

## 9.6 Continuous Improvement

Training materials must be reviewed and updated in response to:

- Changes in AI regulations or standards
- Updates to internal AI systems or tools
- Emergence of new risk vectors or threat models
- Feedback and trends observed from audits or incidents

## 9.7 Roles and Responsibilities

| Role                        | Responsibility                                      |
