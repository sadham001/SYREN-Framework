### 2.4 Regulatory and Legal Compliance Risks

- **Description**: AI systems must comply with a variety of legal and regulatory requirements. Changes in laws, non-compliance with existing laws, or lack of adherence to industry-specific regulations can lead to significant risks.
- **Examples**:
  - Failure to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), resulting in fines and legal consequences for mishandling personal data.
  - Non-compliance with industry-specific regulations such as HIPAA in healthcare or PCI DSS in payment processing.
  - Risk of regulatory scrutiny if AI models violate ethical or societal norms, such as transparency and accountability requirements.

- **Risk Impact**:
  - Financial penalties, fines, and sanctions imposed by regulatory authorities.
  - Damage to brand reputation and stakeholder trust.
  - Legal challenges, including class-action lawsuits or government investigations.

## 3.0 Tools for Risk Identification

AI systems can be complex, and identifying risks often requires the use of specialized tools and frameworks. The following tools are used in AI risk identification to enhance accuracy, provide a structured approach, and ensure comprehensive risk detection.

### 3.1 Static Code Analyzers

- **Description**: Static code analyzers are tools that examine the codebase without executing the program. These tools help detect vulnerabilities such as insecure coding practices, potential security flaws, or bugs that may lead to failures in the model.
- **Examples**:
  - **Checkmarx**: A static code analysis tool that identifies security vulnerabilities in code.
  - **Fortify**: A security testing tool that analyzes code for weaknesses that may lead to exploitable vulnerabilities.

### 3.2 Threat Modeling Frameworks

- **Description**: Threat modeling frameworks provide structured methodologies for identifying and assessing potential security risks. These frameworks are used to analyze the security posture of AI systems and identify areas vulnerable to attacks.
- **Examples**:
  - **STRIDE**: A threat modeling methodology used to identify potential threats based on various categories, such as spoofing, tampering, and information disclosure.
  - **MITRE ATLAS**: A threat modeling framework tailored for analyzing the threats specific to AI and machine learning systems.

### 3.3 Model Explainability Tools

- **Description**: Explainability tools help interpret the decision-making process of AI models, making it easier to understand how inputs lead to outputs. This transparency is critical for identifying unintended biases, ethical issues, and errors in the model's decision process.
- **Examples**:
  - **SHAP** (Shapley Additive Explanations): A method to explain the output of machine learning models by attributing the contribution of each feature to the model's predictions.
  - **LIME** (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations): A tool used to explain black-box models by approximating the model locally with a simpler interpretable model.
