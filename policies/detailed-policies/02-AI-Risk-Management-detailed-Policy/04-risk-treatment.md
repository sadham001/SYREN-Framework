# 04 - Risk Treatment

## 1.0 Introduction

Risk treatment is the structured process of selecting and implementing appropriate measures to modify risks identified through the AI risk assessment process. The goal is to minimize the likelihood and/or impact of adverse outcomes that can result from the deployment and operation of AI systems. Risk treatment ensures AI systems are developed, used, and monitored in a manner aligned with organizational objectives, ethical standards, and regulatory requirements.

---

## 2.0 Objectives of Risk Treatment

The objectives of this risk treatment policy are to:

- Define standardized risk treatment strategies and options suitable for AI-related risks.
- Ensure each identified risk has a corresponding, actionable treatment plan.
- Assign clear accountability for implementing and monitoring risk treatments.
- Promote continuous improvement through feedback loops and iterative updates.
- Encourage transparency and documentation of decisions regarding risk acceptance, reduction, transfer, or avoidance.

## 3.0 Risk Treatment Strategy

A risk treatment strategy outlines the course of action chosen to address each identified risk. The strategy must be informed by the severity level of the risk, organizational priorities, and available resources. Each risk must have at least one associated treatment strategy selected from the options below.

### 3.1 Treatment Options

| Strategy      | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Avoid**     | Modify or discontinue the activity or component giving rise to the risk. For instance, an AI model may be redesigned to exclude high-risk features. |
| **Reduce**    | Implement controls that lower the likelihood or impact of the risk. This may involve improved monitoring, bias mitigation, input validation, or improved access controls. |
| **Transfer**  | Shift the responsibility or liability for the risk to a third party through outsourcing, service-level agreements, or insurance. |
| **Accept**    | Acknowledge the risk when mitigation is not feasible, or the cost of mitigation outweighs the potential impact. Acceptance must be documented and justified. |

Each chosen treatment strategy must be supported by a business justification and recorded in the Risk Register.

## 4.0 Risk Treatment Planning

Once a treatment strategy is selected, a treatment plan should be developed that outlines the following elements:

### 4.1 Components of the Treatment Plan

- **Risk Identifier**: Reference ID from the Risk Register.
- **Treatment Strategy**: Chosen approach (Avoid, Reduce, Transfer, Accept).
- **Implementation Actions**: Specific tasks, configurations, or activities to carry out the treatment.
- **Responsible Parties**: Designated personnel or teams accountable for executing the treatment.
- **Timeline**: Expected start and completion dates.
- **Required Resources**: Personnel, budget, tools, or vendor involvement.
- **Success Metrics**: How treatment effectiveness will be evaluated.
- **Residual Risk**: Any remaining risk after treatment is implemented.

All treatment plans must be stored as part of the system's compliance and audit trail.

## 5.0 Implementation and Monitoring

### 5.1 Execution of Risk Treatments

Once treatment plans are approved, they must be implemented according to the established timeline. Project managers or risk owners are responsible for ensuring timely execution and coordination across teams.

### 5.2 Monitoring Effectiveness

After implementation, the effectiveness of the treatment must be continuously monitored. Monitoring includes:

- Tracking metrics and key risk indicators (KRIs)
- Conducting tests or simulations (e.g., red teaming, bias audits)
- Reviewing incident logs and audit trails
- Updating the Risk Register to reflect status changes

Ineffective treatments must be escalated for reassessment.

---

## 6.0 Documentation and Accountability

All treatment activities must be recorded in the Risk Register and associated audit documentation. Documentation should reflect:

- Decisions made and justification
- Status updates and residual risk evaluation
- Changes made to AI models, processes, or controls
- Final outcome of the treatment (success, partial, failure)

The following roles are accountable:

- **Risk Owner**: Responsible for treatment planning and execution.
- **System Owner**: Ensures alignment with operational constraints and objectives.
- **Governance Committee**: Provides oversight, validation, and policy compliance assurance.

---

## 7.0 Residual Risk Management

### 7.1 Definition

Residual risk is the risk that remains after the implementation of treatment measures. It must be assessed to determine whether it is within the organizationâ€™s acceptable risk threshold.

### 7.2 Action on Residual Risk

If residual risk is **within acceptable limits**, it can be formally accepted and documented. If **outside tolerance**, further treatment measures or system changes must be considered. Formal residual risk acceptance must be:

- Approved by the Governance Committee or a senior risk officer
- Documented in the Risk Register
- Reassessed periodically or after system updates

---

## 8.0 Integration with AI Lifecycle

Risk treatment should be embedded into the AI development and deployment lifecycle:

- **Design Phase**: Use risk assessment results to avoid or reduce design-level risks early.
- **Development Phase**: Implement technical safeguards and risk reduction techniques.
- **Testing Phase**: Test the effectiveness of treatments (e.g., bias detection, adversarial testing).
- **Deployment Phase**: Finalize risk mitigation and set up monitoring processes.
- **Monitoring Phase**: Ongoing evaluation of new or emerging risks and adjustment of treatment.

---

## 9.0 Review and Continuous Improvement

Risk treatment strategies and outcomes should be periodically reviewed as part of the continuous improvement process. Review cycles may be:

- **Quarterly** for critical systems
- **Annually** for systems with stable risk profiles
- **Immediately** following a significant event (incident, model failure, or policy change)

Lessons learned from prior treatments must inform future risk planning and strategy adjustments.

## 10.0 Conclusion

Risk treatment is a vital pillar in the SYREN AI Governance Framework, enabling organizations to translate risk insights into actionable safety and compliance measures. By systematically selecting, implementing, and monitoring treatment strategies, organizations can ensure that AI systems remain secure, fair, and reliable.

Effective risk treatment not only protects against harm but also enables innovation by establishing trust, accountability, and resilience in AI systems. A proactive, transparent, and well-documented risk treatment process is essential for responsible AI deployment across industries and domains.
