# 07 - Third-Party AI Risk

## 1.0 Purpose

This policy outlines the framework for identifying, evaluating, and mitigating risks associated with third-party AI solutions. These include externally developed AI tools, SaaS platforms embedding AI capabilities, APIs, and AI service providers. The goal is to ensure that third-party integrations align with the organization's security, ethical, regulatory, and operational standards.

---

## 2.0 Scope

This policy applies to all departments, units, and teams that procure, integrate, or interact with AI-based solutions developed or operated by third-party vendors. It includes:

- Cloud-based AI services (e.g., AI APIs, SaaS analytics).
- Embedded AI in enterprise software platforms (e.g., CRM, HRMS).
- Custom AI solutions developed by contractors or consultants.
- Open-source AI models and libraries.

---

## 3.0 Risk Categories

Third-party AI introduces several risk dimensions:

- **Security Risks**: Data leakage, unauthorized access, insecure APIs, and lack of encryption.
- **Compliance Risks**: Non-compliance with data residency laws, GDPR, HIPAA, etc.
- **Operational Risks**: Downtime, lack of SLAs, and poor model performance.
- **Ethical Risks**: Use of biased, opaque, or non-explainable AI.
- **Reputational Risks**: Association with vendors using unethical data sources or practices.
- **Supply Chain Risks**: Cascading effects of vulnerabilities in upstream providers.

---

## 4.0 Vendor Risk Assessment Framework

### 4.1 Pre-Engagement Assessment

Before onboarding any third-party AI vendor, the following assessments must be conducted:

- **Vendor Due Diligence**: Assess security posture, privacy practices, certifications (e.g., ISO 27001, SOC 2), and ethical guidelines.
- **AI Transparency**: Demand documentation of model type, data sources, fairness metrics, explainability, and update cycles.
- **Data Handling Assessment**: Verify how the vendor stores, processes, and shares organizational and user data.
- **Model Governance**: Ensure the vendor has procedures for model validation, versioning, and monitoring.

### 4.2 Risk Scoring Matrix

Vendors should be assigned a risk score based on:

| Criteria               | Low (1) | Medium (2-3) | High (4-5) |
|------------------------|---------|--------------|------------|
| Data Sensitivity       | Public  | Internal     | PII/PHI    |
| Integration Depth      | Standalone | Partial access | Full access to systems |
| Regulatory Impact      | None    | Indirect     | Direct legal risk |
| Ethical Complexity     | None    | Some AI bias potential | High-stakes automation |
| Control Limitations    | Full control | Shared control | Minimal control |

Total scores should guide the level of oversight and review needed.

---

## 5.0 Risk Mitigation Strategies

- **Contracts and SLAs**: Mandate AI-specific clauses in vendor agreements including privacy, audit rights, retraining frequency, and explainability.
- **Security Controls**: Require encryption, access control, threat monitoring, and regular penetration tests.
- **Auditability**: Demand logging and traceability of AI decisions where applicable.
- **Ethics and Fairness**: Require vendors to disclose bias testing, demographic performance, and opt-out mechanisms for users.
- **Exit Strategies**: Plan for vendor discontinuation, including data handover, model migration, and contractual disengagement.

---

## 6.0 Ongoing Monitoring and Reassessment

Third-party AI risk does not end with onboarding. Ongoing oversight is essential.

### 6.1 Monitoring Guidelines

- **Monthly/Quarterly Monitoring**: For high-risk vendors, including model performance, incident reports, and data processing logs.
- **Annual Reassessments**: Review vendor risk profile annually or upon significant changes (e.g., new feature, data breach, acquisition).
- **Incident Response Integration**: Ensure vendors are included in internal incident response playbooks.

### 6.2 Key Indicators for Review Triggers

- SLA breaches or unexplained model changes.
- Customer complaints or legal threats related to vendor AI output.
- Regulatory updates affecting data handling or model governance.

## 7.0 Roles and Responsibilities

| Role                 | Responsibility                                                                 |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Procurement          | Ensure vendors are vetted for AI-specific risks during the selection process.  |
| IT Security          | Evaluate and monitor vendor infrastructure and data practices.                 |
| Data Protection Officer (DPO) | Ensure vendor compliance with data privacy laws.                    |
| AI Governance Committee | Approve high-risk third-party AI use and ensure alignment with AI policy.  |
| Business Owners      | Monitor vendor performance and raise issues during operations.                 |

---

## 8.0 Integration into Risk Register

All third-party AI vendors must be documented in the organizationâ€™s **AI Risk Register**, including:

- Vendor name and AI service description.
- Assigned risk level and justification.
- Current status and review date.
- Associated controls and responsible owners.

---

## 9.0 Non-Compliance and Enforcement

Failure to adhere to this policy may result in:

- Termination of third-party contracts.
- Revocation of internal access rights.
- Formal investigation and internal disciplinary action for responsible staff.

Vendors in breach of contract must be flagged and escalated for legal review.

## 10.0 Conclusion

Third-party AI systems are integral to modern digital operations, but they introduce unique and complex risks. A robust third-party AI risk policy ensures that all external AI systems are aligned with organizational standards for security, ethics, transparency, and compliance.

By adopting this framework, SYREN ensures that it not only leverages the best of AI innovation but also upholds trust, accountability, and long-term operational resilience in its AI ecosystem
