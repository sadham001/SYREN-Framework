# 08 - Incident Response Integration

## 1.0 Purpose

This policy defines how AI-related incidents are integrated into the broader organizational incident response framework. It ensures that AI-specific risks, including system failures, unintended outputs, data breaches, or ethical violations, are identified, reported, and mitigated promptly and systematically.

---

## 2.0 Scope

This policy applies to:

- AI systems developed or deployed internally.
- Third-party AI services used within the organization.
- AI-driven automation or decision-making tools affecting users or operations.
- AI infrastructure, including model training, inference pipelines, and data handling.

---

## 3.0 AI-Specific Incident Types

AI incidents may differ from traditional IT incidents. Key categories include:

- **Model Misbehavior**: Output deviates from expected behavior, leading to harm or disruption.
- **Bias or Discrimination**: Harmful treatment of individuals or groups based on protected attributes.
- **Data Leakage**: Exposure of training or inference data (e.g., PII, trade secrets).
- **Adversarial Attacks**: Inputs crafted to fool the AI system (e.g., prompt injection, evasion attacks).
- **System Failure**: Model crashes, unavailability, or integration errors disrupting services.
- **Ethical Breach**: Use of AI in ways that violate internal values or external regulations.

---

## 4.0 Incident Response Phases for AI

### 4.1 Detection

- Use monitoring tools to track unusual model behavior, confidence scores, and response times.
- Enable alerting for output anomalies, unexpected input distributions, or feedback loops.
- Encourage reporting from users and stakeholders via defined communication channels.

### 4.2 Triage and Classification

- Classify AI incidents using severity levels:
  - **Critical**: Immediate legal, reputational, or user safety threat.
  - **High**: Disruption of business operations or high-impact decision errors.
  - **Medium**: Limited user impact or internal misclassification.
  - **Low**: Minor deviations without significant consequences.

- Assign ownership based on the domain of the impacted AI system.

### 4.3 Containment

- Disable affected models or switch to fallback/manual modes.
- Isolate compromised APIs, pipelines, or data stores.
- Revoke temporary credentials or user sessions where necessary.

### 4.4 Investigation and Root Cause Analysis

- Conduct model behavior analysis and review recent changes (code, data, weights).
- Trace logs for inputs, decisions, and affected components.
- Investigate model drift, corrupted data, or unauthorized access.

### 4.5 Remediation

- Retrain or fine-tune models to correct errant behavior.
- Patch integration bugs or secure vulnerable endpoints.
- Revise data handling, pre-processing, or access control mechanisms.

## 5.0 Roles and Responsibilities

| Role                         | Responsibility                                                                 |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AI Incident Response Lead    | Coordinate AI-specific triage, root cause analysis, and remediation.           |
| Security Operations Center   | Monitor for AI security anomalies and execute containment protocols.           |
| Data Science Team            | Analyze model outputs, investigate drift or data quality issues.               |
| Legal and Compliance         | Evaluate legal exposure and reporting requirements.                           |
| Communications               | Manage internal and external communications in the event of public incidents. |

## 6.0 Integration with Broader Incident Response Plan

AI incident response must align with the organizational IR policy by:

- Using common incident tracking systems (e.g., Jira, ServiceNow, SOAR).
- Participating in cross-functional incident reviews and post-mortems.
- Applying escalation thresholds in line with corporate policy.
- Reporting to regulators or stakeholders where required (e.g., data breach laws, AI Act).

---

## 7.0 Documentation and Reporting

All AI-related incidents must be logged and documented. Incident reports should include:

- **Incident ID and Date**
- **Description of the Issue**
- **Impacted Systems and Users**
- **Severity Level**
- **Detection Method**
- **Root Cause Summary**
- **Remediation Actions**
- **Lessons Learned**
- **Preventive Measures**

Reports must be reviewed by the AI Governance Committee and filed for audit purposes.

---

## 8.0 Lessons Learned and Feedback Loop

Post-incident reviews must include:

- Evaluation of model performance assumptions.
- Review of ethical risks or societal harms caused.
- Updates to risk registers and model cards.
- Required retraining, documentation, or policy changes.

Feedback should be looped into future AI design, testing, and deployment practices.

---

## 9.0 Training and Simulation

- Conduct AI incident response drills at least annually.
- Include AI-specific scenarios in tabletop exercises.
- Ensure teams are familiar with triage protocols, communication flows, and escalation rules.

---

## 10.0 Conclusion

AI introduces new dimensions of risk that demand specialized incident response readiness. This policy ensures that AI-related incidents are handled with the same rigor and structure as traditional IT incidentsâ€”while addressing the unique characteristics of AI failures.

By embedding AI risks into the broader incident response lifecycle, SYREN reinforces trust, transparency, and accountability across its AI ecosystem.
