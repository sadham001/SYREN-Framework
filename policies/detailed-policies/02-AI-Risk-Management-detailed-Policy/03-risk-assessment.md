# 03 - AI Risk Assessment

## 1.0 Introduction

AI systems, by their nature, introduce unique and complex risks that must be thoroughly assessed. Risk assessment is the process of identifying, evaluating, and prioritizing risks associated with the design, deployment, and operation of AI systems. A comprehensive AI risk assessment ensures that potential threats are mitigated proactively, thereby fostering trust, enhancing resilience, and ensuring alignment with legal, ethical, and security requirements.

This document outlines the framework for AI Risk Assessment under the SYREN policy structure. It provides guidance on methodologies, risk rating mechanisms, prioritization strategies, and documentation practices essential for AI governance.

## 2.0 Objectives of AI Risk Assessment

The objectives of AI risk assessment are as follows:

- To identify potential threats and vulnerabilities in AI systems, including model behavior, data pipelines, deployment environments, and user interaction points.
- To evaluate the likelihood and impact of those risks across operational, ethical, regulatory, and security dimensions.
- To prioritize risks and determine appropriate mitigation strategies.
- To ensure continuous monitoring, assessment, and adaptation in response to changing technologies or threat landscapes.

## 3.0 Risk Assessment Methodology

A consistent, structured approach is required to assess AI risks across diverse systems and environments. SYREN adopts a hybrid methodology combining traditional risk management frameworks (e.g., ISO 27005, NIST RMF) with AI-specific considerations such as bias, model drift, adversarial inputs, and explainability.

The process consists of the following steps:

1. **Risk Identification**  
   - Identify risks across the AI lifecycle (development, training, deployment, monitoring).
   - Sources of risks include technical flaws, ethical misalignment, data anomalies, third-party integrations, user misuse, and regulatory non-compliance.

2. **Risk Evaluation**  
   - Assess the likelihood and impact of each identified risk.
   - Assign numerical values based on defined criteria (see Section 3.1).

3. **Risk Rating**  
   - Use a risk matrix to determine risk score (likelihood × impact).

4. **Prioritization and Treatment**  
   - Rank risks based on scores and business relevance.
   - Determine treatment strategies (see Section 6).

### 3.1 Likelihood and Impact Rating Criteria

To standardize the evaluation process, risks are assessed based on two dimensions:

#### Likelihood Rating

| Rating | Description                          |
|--------|--------------------------------------|
| 1      | Rare – unlikely to occur             |
| 2      | Unlikely – infrequent but possible   |
| 3      | Possible – may occur occasionally    |
| 4      | Likely – expected to occur           |
| 5      | Almost Certain – will occur frequently |

#### Impact Rating

| Rating | Description                                               |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Negligible – No material impact                           |
| 2      | Minor – Small inconvenience or minimal impact             |
| 3      | Moderate – Noticeable operational or stakeholder impact   |
| 4      | Major – High financial, reputational, or legal consequences |
| 5      | Catastrophic – Severe disruption or non-recoverable damage |

**Risk Score = Likelihood Rating × Impact Rating**

### 3.2 Risk Levels

To quantify risk severity, SYREN utilizes a structured risk matrix:

| Score Range | Risk Level |
|-------------|------------|
| 1 - 4       | Low        |
| 5 - 9       | Medium     |
| 10 - 15     | High       |
| 16 - 25     | Critical   |

---

## 4.0 Documentation of Risk Assessment

Each AI system must maintain documented evidence of its risk assessments. This includes:

- Description of system functionality
- List of identified risks
- Likelihood and impact scoring
- Overall risk score and risk level
- Mitigation or acceptance decisions
- Responsible personnel and dates

---

## 5.0 Risk Prioritization

After evaluating risks, they must be prioritized to determine which risks require immediate attention and which can be monitored over time. Prioritization is based on both the risk score and the business impact, ensuring that the most significant risks are addressed first.

### 5.1 Risk Prioritization Criteria

- **Risk Score**: Higher-risk scores (i.e., those with a higher likelihood and greater impact) should be prioritized for immediate mitigation.
- **Business Impact**: Risks that could disrupt core business functions or harm stakeholders should be prioritized, even if their risk score is not the highest.
- **Regulatory Requirements**: Risks that involve non-compliance with laws and regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) should be treated as high priority due to the potential legal and reputational consequences.

### 5.2 Risk Mitigation Focus

The primary goal of prioritization is to ensure that resources are allocated effectively to mitigate the most pressing risks. This includes deploying advanced monitoring tools, implementing mitigation strategies, and continuously assessing risks.

---

## 6.0 Risk Treatment

Risk treatment involves developing and implementing strategies to manage identified risks. The goal is to reduce the likelihood of risk occurrence or minimize its potential impact.

### 6.1 Treatment Options

Risk treatment strategies can be categorized into four primary options:

- **Avoid**: Eliminate the risk by changing the AI system design or removing the risky component altogether.
- **Reduce**: Implement controls or mitigation measures to reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk.
- **Transfer**: Shift the risk to a third party, such as outsourcing, insurance, or vendor management.
- **Accept**: Acknowledge the risk and continue operations, typically when the risk is low and the cost of mitigation outweighs the potential impact.

### 6.2 Risk Treatment Plan

For each high-priority risk, a detailed treatment plan should be developed, including:

- **Risk Treatment Strategy**: The specific action taken to address the risk (e.g., model redesign, data encryption).
- **Responsible Parties**: The teams or individuals accountable for implementing the treatment plan.
- **Timeline**: The time frame within which the risk treatment must be completed.
- **Monitoring and Evaluation**: Continuous monitoring to ensure the treatment plan’s effectiveness and reassessment if the risk evolves.

## 7.0 Risk Register

A Risk Register is a crucial tool for tracking and managing identified risks. It serves as a living document that records each risk, its assessment, treatment status, and any changes in the risk landscape.

### 7.1 Risk Register Contents

The Risk Register should include the following key elements:

- **Risk ID**: A unique identifier for each risk.
- **Risk Description**: A detailed description of the risk.
- **Risk Category**: The category of the risk (e.g., operational, security, ethical).
- **Likelihood Rating**: The assessed likelihood of the risk occurring.
- **Impact Rating**: The assessed potential impact of the risk.
- **Risk Score**: The overall risk score.
- **Mitigation Strategy**: The action(s) taken to mitigate the risk.
- **Responsible Party**: The person or team responsible for managing the risk.
- **Status**: The current status of the risk (e.g., open, mitigated, closed).
- **Review Date**: The last review date and next scheduled review.

---

## 8.0 Risk Assessment Review and Update

Risk assessments must be reviewed regularly to ensure that they remain current and reflect changes in the AI system, operational environment, and external factors such as regulatory updates or emerging threats.

### 8.1 Frequency of Reviews

- **Quarterly**: High-risk systems or newly deployed models should undergo frequent reviews to assess potential changes in risk.
- **Annually**: A comprehensive review of all risks should be conducted at least once a year to ensure that all potential threats are identified and managed appropriately.

### 8.2 Post-Incident Reviews

After any significant security incident, operational failure, or regulatory update, a post-incident review should be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the risk assessment and treatment strategies.
