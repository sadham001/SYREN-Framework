# 02 - AI Risk Management Policy (Detailed)

*Auto-generated by SYREN PolicyGPT*

---

## 1.0 Introduction

Effective AI risk management ensures the identification, evaluation, mitigation, and continuous monitoring of potential threats or failures across all AI components of the SYREN cybersecurity framework. This document provides a structured methodology aligned with international standards such as ISO 27001, NIST, and GDPR.

## 2.0 Risk Management Lifecycle

### 2.1 Risk Identification

- Sources:
  - Model output inconsistencies
  - Training data anomalies
  - Adversarial input simulation
  - Regulatory updates

- Tools:
  - Static code analyzers
  - Threat modeling frameworks (STRIDE, MITRE ATLAS)
  - NLP model explainers (e.g., SHAP, LIME)

### 2.2 Risk Assessment

 **Risk Scoring Formula**:
Risk Score = Likelihood Ã— Impact

- Categories:
- Operational Risk
- Privacy/Data Risk
- Ethical/Bias Risk
- Regulatory Non-Compliance
- Security Exposure (e.g., model inversion)

 **Risk Levels**

| Score Range | Risk Level   |
|-------------|--------------|
| 1 - 4       | Low          |
| 5 - 9       | Medium       |
| 10 - 15     | High         |
| 16 - 25     | Critical     |

**Assessment Categories**:
- **Operational Risk**: Errors due to automation, incorrect outputs, system downtime.
- **Privacy & Data Risk**: Data leakage, re-identification, or unintended exposure.
- **Ethical & Bias Risk**: Algorithmic bias, exclusion, or discrimination in decisions.
- **Regulatory Non-Compliance**: Violation of GDPR, ISO, or other frameworks.
- **Security Exposure**: Model inversion, prompt injection, adversarial attacks.

### 2.3 Risk Treatment

| Treatment Option | Description                                |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Avoid            | Stop development or deployment             |
| Reduce           | Implement mitigation controls              |
| Transfer         | Outsource or insure                        |
| Accept           | Document and monitor residual risk         |

## 3.0 Risk Register

- Maintained by the CAIRO
- Fields:
- Risk ID
- Description
- Severity (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
- Treatment Plan
- Owner
- Status (Open, Mitigated, Closed)

- Updated:
- After major deployments
- Following internal audits
- When regulatory alerts are issued

---

## 4.0 Model-Level Risk Controls

| Model Type       | Key Controls                              |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| NLP              | Bias audits, adversarial text simulation   |
| CV (Computer Vision) | Dataset diversity, output drift detection |
| Predictive       | False positive thresholds, transparency logs |

- **Versioning**: Every model iteration must be tagged and archived with a rollback strategy.
- **Explainability**: Integration of interpretability tools is mandatory.

---

## 5.0 Third-Party Risk

- All vendors and AI service providers must:
- Share risk assessment documentation
- Sign a Model Security Assurance Agreement
- Undergo quarterly compliance reviews

---

## 6.0 Incident Response Integration

- AI incidents such as data leaks, hallucinations, or bias triggers must:
- Be classified under the SYREN IR policy (Policy 06)
- Initiate a root cause analysis (RCA)
- Be reviewed by CAIRO and logged in the Risk Register

---

## 7.0 Training & Awareness

- Mandatory training for:
- Risk identification techniques
- Scenario-based simulation and tabletop exercises
- Regulatory landscape updates (AI Act, GDPR, etc.)

- Frequency:
- Bi-annually or after major policy changes

---

## 8.0 Compliance Mapping

| Risk Area         | ISO 27001 | NIST 800-53 | GDPR     |
|-------------------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Risk Assessment   | A.8.2     | RA-3        | Art. 35  |
| Controls & Actions| A.12.6    | SI-2        | Art. 32  |
| Third-Party Risk  | A.15.1    | SA-9        | Art. 28  |

---

## 9.0 Review Cycle

- **Policy Owner:** CAIRO
- **Initial Author:** Security Governance Lead
- **Review Frequency:** Annual or post major deployment
- **Next Scheduled Review:** January 2026
