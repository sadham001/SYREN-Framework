# 02 - AI Risk Management Policy (Detailed)

*Auto-generated by SYREN PolicyGPT*

---

## 1.0 Introduction

Effective AI risk management ensures the identification, evaluation, mitigation, and continuous monitoring of potential threats or failures across all AI components of the SYREN cybersecurity framework. This document provides a structured methodology aligned with international standards such as ISO 27001, NIST, and GDPR.

## 2.0 Risk Management Lifecycle

### 2.1 Risk Identification

- Sources:
  - Model output inconsistencies
  - Training data anomalies
  - Adversarial input simulation
  - Regulatory updates

- Tools:
  - Static code analyzers
  - Threat modeling frameworks (STRIDE, MITRE ATLAS)
  - NLP model explainers (e.g., SHAP, LIME)

### 2.2 Risk Assessment

 **Risk Scoring Formula**:
Risk Score = Likelihood × Impact

- Categories:
- Operational Risk
- Privacy/Data Risk
- Ethical/Bias Risk
- Regulatory Non-Compliance
- Security Exposure (e.g., model inversion)

 **Risk Levels**

| Score Range | Risk Level   |
|-------------|--------------|
| 1 - 4       | Low          |
| 5 - 9       | Medium       |
| 10 - 15     | High         |
| 16 - 25     | Critical     |

**Assessment Categories**:
- **Operational Risk**: Errors due to automation, incorrect outputs, system downtime.
- **Privacy & Data Risk**: Data leakage, re-identification, or unintended exposure.
- **Ethical & Bias Risk**: Algorithmic bias, exclusion, or discrimination in decisions.
- **Regulatory Non-Compliance**: Violation of GDPR, ISO, or other frameworks.
- **Security Exposure**: Model inversion, prompt injection, adversarial attacks.

### 2.3 Risk Treatment

| Treatment Option | Description                                |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Avoid            | Stop development or deployment             |
| Reduce           | Implement mitigation controls              |
| Transfer         | Outsource or insure                        |
| Accept           | Document and monitor residual risk         |

## 3.0 Risk Register

**Maintained by**: Chief AI Risk Officer (CAIRO)

**Contents**:

- Unique Risk ID
- Description
- Severity (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
- Source of Risk
- Likelihood Score
- Impact Score
- Treatment Strategy
- Status (Open, Mitigated, Closed)
- Owner and Reviewer

- **Update Triggers**:
- Post deployment
- Regulatory change
- Discovery of a new vulnerability
- Internal audit or incident

## 4.0 Model-Level Risk Controls

| AI Model Type      | Risk Controls Implemented                                                 |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NLP                | Bias auditing, adversarial input testing, prompt logging                 |
| Computer Vision    | Dataset diversity enforcement, bounding box validation, output drift checks |
| Predictive Models  | Accuracy thresholding, false positive/negative rate monitoring           |
| Reinforcement Learning | Fail-safe logic for reward hacking prevention, policy clipping     |

- **Explainability Requirement**: Use of SHAP, LIME, or similar tools is mandatory for all high-impact AI decisions.
- **Rollback Strategy**: Model versions must be version-controlled with rollback capability on failure detection.

---

## 5.0 Third-Party AI Risk

- **Onboarding Requirements**:
- Security and privacy posture report
- Documented risk assessments of models/tools
- NDA and compliance alignment with SYREN policies

- **Continuous Monitoring**:
- Quarterly reviews
- Re-validation after major vendor updates
- AI-specific penetration testing where applicable

---

## 6.0 Incident Response Integration

- All AI incidents such as hallucination, bias trigger, or unauthorized model manipulation must:
- Be logged in the SYREN Incident Register
- Escalated to CAIRO for review within 24 hours
- Follow a documented root cause analysis (RCA)
- Initiate immediate model suspension if critical

- **Cross-Policy Integration**:
- Links to Policy 06: Incident Detection and Response
- Referenced by: Policy 01, 07, and 09

---

## 7.0 Training & Awareness

- **Who Must Be Trained**:
- Developers, Data Scientists, Security Engineers, Policy Owners
- **Training Modules**:
- Risk awareness and simulation labs
- Regulatory updates and compliance
- Threat modeling for AI/ML systems

- **Schedule**: Every 6 months or after any significant risk event.

## 8.0 Compliance Alignment

| Compliance Framework | Relevant Section(s)                       |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| ISO/IEC 27001        | A.6.1.2 (Risk Assessment), A.12.6 (Vulnerability) |
| NIST SP 800-53       | RA-3, SI-4, CA-7                          |
| EU GDPR              | Article 35 (DPIA), Article 25 (Data Protection by Design) |
| AI Act (EU)          | Title III, Chapter 2 (Risk Management in High-Risk AI) |

---

## 9.0 Review Cycle

- **Policy Owner**: Chief AI Risk Officer
- **Last Reviewed**: April 2025
- **Next Scheduled Review**: April 2026
- **Review Frequency**: Annual or when triggered by:
- A major AI deployment
- Regulatory updates
- Post-incident response
