# 06 - Risk Review and Update

## 1.0 Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to define the requirements and procedures for regularly reviewing and updating AI risk assessments and associated documentation. Continuous evaluation ensures that AI risks are effectively monitored and managed in alignment with organizational objectives and evolving threats, technologies, and regulatory landscapes.

---

## 2.0 Scope

This policy applies to all AI systems and models deployed, piloted, or in development within the organization. It encompasses internal tools, third-party AI integrations, and SaaS platforms that include embedded AI functionalities.

---

## 3.0 Policy Objectives

- Maintain up-to-date risk profiles for all AI assets.
- Ensure identified risks are still relevant and adequately treated.
- Identify emerging risks due to environmental, regulatory, or technological changes.
- Ensure accountability through clearly defined review responsibilities and frequencies.

## 4.0 Review Frequency

AI risk reviews must follow a structured schedule based on the risk level, use case criticality, and model lifecycle phase.

### 4.1 Scheduled Reviews

| Risk Level | Minimum Review Frequency |
|------------|--------------------------|
| Critical   | Quarterly                |
| High       | Semi-annually            |
| Medium     | Annually                 |
| Low        | Every two years          |

### 4.2 Event-Driven Reviews

Unscheduled risk reviews must be triggered by any of the following:

- Deployment of new models or significant model updates.
- Discovery of new threats or vulnerabilities.
- Post-incident investigations (e.g., ethical failure, bias event, system breach).
- Legal, regulatory, or industry-standard changes (e.g., GDPR updates, ISO AI standards).
- Shifts in business operations or organizational priorities.

---

## 5.0 Review Process

Each AI risk review must follow these steps:

### 5.1 Preparation

- Collect the latest information about the AI system, including model updates, operational changes, or known incidents.
- Gather performance and audit logs, stakeholder feedback, and treatment effectiveness reports.

### 5.2 Reassessment

- Re-evaluate the likelihood and impact scores for each risk item.
- Verify the current relevance of previously identified risks.
- Assess any new risks or threats that have emerged since the last review.

### 5.3 Documentation and Update

- Update the Risk Register with revised scores, statuses, and justifications.
- Record new risks, mitigations, and changed control effectiveness assessments.
- Maintain a historical audit trail of all review cycles and outcomes.

## 7.0 Monitoring and Automation

Organizations should leverage tools to automate review reminders, notifications, and workflow tracking to avoid delays and missed cycles.

### 7.1 Recommended Capabilities

- Automated risk scoring updates based on model drift or monitoring alerts.
- Dashboards showing upcoming and overdue reviews.
- Review templates and checklist automation.
- Workflow integration with GRC or MLOps tools.

---

## 8.0 Compliance and Reporting

Review activities must be recorded and retained in accordance with audit and compliance standards.
