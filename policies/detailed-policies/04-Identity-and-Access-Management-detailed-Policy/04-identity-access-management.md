# 04 – Identity and Access Management (Detailed Policy)

*Auto-generated by SYREN PolicyGPT*

---

## 1.0 Purpose

To define the controls and procedures for managing user identities, authentication, authorization, and access privileges across SYREN’s AI-driven infrastructure, in compliance with global security frameworks.

---

## 2.0 Scope

- Applies to all users, systems, services, and third-party vendors accessing SYREN platforms.
- Includes AI models, APIs, dashboards, databases, cloud workloads, and SaaS tools.
- Covers both human and non-human (machine, service) identities.

---

## 3.0 Identity Lifecycle Management

| Phase              | Activities                                                  |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Onboarding         | Identity provisioning, role assignment, MFA enrollment      |
| Role Changes       | Role-based access review, privilege adjustment               |
| Offboarding        | Immediate deactivation, credential revocation                |

- All identities are mapped to roles using the principle of least privilege (PoLP).
- Temporary access is logged and auto-expired.

---

## 4.0 Authentication Standards

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** is mandatory for:
  - All admin and developer accounts
  - External contractors and consultants
  - Access to production and model training environments
- **Password Policy**:
  - Minimum 14 characters
  - Must include upper/lowercase, digit, and special character
  - Expire every 90 days

- Support for:
  - SSO (SAML2/OIDC)
  - Biometric authentication (for internal secure zones)

---

## 5.0 Access Controls

| Type                     | Description                                                      |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) | Access granted based on job function or responsibility     |
| Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) | Conditional access based on user/device/context attributes |
| Just-In-Time (JIT) Access | Time-bound access for sensitive systems                          |
| Segregation of Duties    | Prevents conflicting roles (e.g., Dev and Prod admin together)   |

---

## 6.0 Machine Identity Management

- All APIs, bots, AI agents, and automation tools must:
  - Be registered as service identities
  - Use client certificates or token-based authentication
  - Rotate keys every 90 days

- An inventory of non-human identities must be maintained.

---

## 7.0 Privileged Access Management (PAM)

- Privileged sessions are:
  - Monitored and logged using SIEM
  - Require approval via ticketing system
  - Auto-terminated after 15 minutes of inactivity

- Use of break-glass accounts is restricted and monitored.

---

## 8.0 Logging and Monitoring

- Logs captured for:
  - Login attempts, privilege escalations, failed authentications
  - Changes in RBAC or group membership
- Logs are retained for 12 months in immutable storage.
- Integrated with UEBA (User and Entity Behavior Analytics) for anomaly detection.

---

## 9.0 Third-Party Access

| Category            | Requirements                                                            |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Vendors             | Must use federated ID or dedicated least-privilege accounts             |
| Auditors            | Read-only time-bound access via approval workflow                       |
| API Consumers       | Must authenticate via API gateway with OAuth 2.0 and rate-limiting      |

- All third-party accesses are reviewed quarterly.

---

## 10.0 Roles and Responsibilities

| Role                 | Responsibilities                                                    |

| IAM Administrator    | Manages user provisioning, RBAC, and access requests                |
| CISO/CTO             | Approves privileged access and reviews escalation logs              |
| DevOps & IT Teams    | Implement and monitor identity controls                             |
| Data Owners          | Define access permissions for sensitive datasets                    |
| Compliance Officer   | Ensures alignment with ISO 27001, NIST 800-63, and local regulations|

## 11.0 Compliance Alignment

|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| ISO/IEC 27001        | A.9 – Access Control, A.10 – Cryptography       |

| CIS Controls v8      | Controls 6 (Access Control), 16 (Account Monitoring) |
| UAE IA Standards     | Section 5.1 – Identity & Access Security        |
