# 06 – Incident Detection and Response (Detailed Policy)

*Auto-generated by SYREN PolicyGPT*

---

## 1.0 Purpose

This policy defines the approach for detecting, analyzing, and responding to security incidents within SYREN’s AI-powered cybersecurity infrastructure. It aims to ensure that threats are identified quickly and mitigated effectively, minimizing potential damage.

---

## 2.0 Scope

This policy applies to:
- All AI-driven models, endpoints, and infrastructure within SYREN.
- Security teams, incident response personnel, AI engineers, and other relevant stakeholders.
- Third-party contractors or external partners with access to SYREN systems.

## 3.0 Incident Classification

Incidents are classified based on severity, impact, and potential for escalation. Below are the standard classification levels:

| Severity Level   | Description                                              | Response Actions                        |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Low              | Minor anomalies that do not indicate immediate risk      | Monitoring and alerting                  |
| Medium           | Potential security issues that need investigation        | Immediate investigation, mitigation     |
| High             | Significant security breach or threat, requires urgent response | Immediate containment, full incident response |
| Critical         | Ongoing major attack (e.g., data exfiltration, system compromise) | Full-scale incident response with recovery and forensic analysis |

## 4.0 Incident Detection

### 4.1 AI-Powered Detection Tools
- SYREN uses AI-powered detection systems to monitor data traffic, API calls, user behavior, and other activity logs.
- Key detection systems include:
  - **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies abnormal user or system behavior.
  - **Signature-Based Detection**: Matches known threat signatures.
  - **Behavioral Analytics**: Tracks deviation from established patterns.

### 4.2 Alerts and Thresholds
- Alerts are generated when detected anomalies or threshold breaches occur. 
- Thresholds include but are not limited to:
  - Unusual login times, geo-location shifts
  - Excessive data exfiltration
  - Unusual API requests and traffic spikes

### 4.3 Log Aggregation and Correlation
- Logs are aggregated from all systems and centralized in a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system.
- AI models continuously analyze logs for correlating potential incidents across multiple sources.

---

## 5.0 Incident Response Process

### 5.1 Detection and Triage
- Upon detecting an incident, the AI-driven monitoring system will trigger alerts.
- Security analysts will assess the incident based on severity and potential impact.
- Initial triage includes:
  - Identifying affected systems and stakeholders.
  - Categorizing the incident (e.g., breach, DDoS, insider threat).

### 5.2 Containment
- High and critical incidents are immediately contained to prevent further damage.
- Actions include:
  - Isolating affected systems or models.
  - Disabling or quarantining compromised accounts.
  - Blocking malicious IP addresses or traffic patterns.

### 5.3 Eradication
- Once containment is achieved, focus shifts to eliminating the root cause.
- For AI-based threats, this could involve:
  - Patching model vulnerabilities.
  - Removing compromised data or code.
  - Rebuilding affected systems from clean backups.

### 5.4 Recovery
- After eradication, affected systems are restored to normal operations.
- Actions include:
  - Restoring from backups.
  - Re-enabling isolated services with added security.
  - Running additional tests to verify integrity and security.

### 5.5 Post-Incident Analysis
- A root cause analysis (RCA) is conducted to understand the origin of the incident and its full impact.
- Recommendations for process and system improvements are documented.
- Incident reports are generated for internal and external stakeholders.

## 6.0 Roles and Responsibilities

| Role                | Responsibilities                                                |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Incident Response Team (IRT) | Manages all incident response activities and coordination |
| Security Analysts   | Monitors security systems, responds to alerts, and analyzes incidents |
| AI Engineers        | Investigates and resolves AI model-based incidents             |
| IT Operations       | Assists in system recovery, patching, and restoring services    |
| SOC Team            | Supports monitoring, escalation, and continuous threat intelligence |

---

## 7.0 Compliance and Audit

- All incidents are logged and documented in a centralized database for future reference.
- Reports are created for regulatory compliance (GDPR, ISO 27001, etc.) and shared with relevant stakeholders.
- Incident response procedures are audited quarterly to ensure adherence to best practices and compliance requirements.

---

## 8.0 Monitoring and Continuous Improvement

- Incident response capabilities are reviewed after every significant event.
- AI models are updated to reflect new attack patterns, detected threats, and evolving cybersecurity techniques.
- Training programs are held annually for staff to stay updated on the latest incident detection and response techniques.

---

## 9.0 Review Cycle

- **Owner**: Incident Response Manager
- **Last Reviewed**: April 2025
- **Next Review**: April 2026 or after any major incident or policy change
- **Frequency**: Annual review or following a major cybersecurity event
