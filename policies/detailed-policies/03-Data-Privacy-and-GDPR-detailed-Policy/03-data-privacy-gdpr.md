## 1.0 Purpose

To ensure that all personal data handled by SYREN’s AI systems is collected, processed, stored, and deleted in accordance with global data protection laws, including but not limited to the EU GDPR, UAE DP Law, and CCPA. This policy aims to integrate privacy into the core design of all systems.

---

## 2.0 Scope

- Applies to all SYREN systems that process personal data (structured or unstructured).
- Encompasses internal staff, contractors, customers, and third-party services that interact with AI-driven systems.
- Includes structured data, metadata, audio/video feeds, NLP models, logs, and inferred attributes.

## 5.0 User Rights Handling

| Right                    | Handling Protocol                                                   |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Right to Access          | Portal/API endpoint for data access requests.                       |
| Right to Rectification   | Correction within 10 business days.                                 |
| Right to Erasure         | Deletion within 30 days unless legally exempted.                    |
| Right to Data Portability| Export in machine-readable format (JSON/CSV).                       |
| Right to Object          | Record objection and halt processing where required.                |
| Right to Restriction     | Suspend processing during investigation.                            |

## 6.0 Data Protection by Design and by Default

- AI systems must:
  - Use privacy-preserving techniques (e.g., differential privacy, pseudonymization).
  - Log every access and training process involving personal data.
  - Avoid training models directly on raw personal data unless anonymized or encrypted.
- Each release must pass a privacy impact checklist.

---

## 7.0 Data Retention and Deletion

| Data Category           | Retention Period         | Deletion Mechanism        |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| User PII (e.g. email)   | 1 year after inactivity   | Secure wipe via DLP script|
| Logs & System Metadata  | 6 months                 | Auto-expire via cron job  |
| Model Training Data     | 2 years                  | Version purge & overwrite |

- An audit trail is maintained for each deletion process.

---

## 8.0 Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)

- Required when:
  - Deploying new AI model with personal data
  - Changing the scope of existing processing
  - Using large-scale profiling or sensitive categories (e.g., biometric, racial data)

- DPIA Components:
  - Processing Description
  - Necessity & Proportionality
  - Risk to Rights & Freedoms
  - Mitigation Measures

---

## 9.0 Cross-border Data Transfers

- Transfers must comply with:
  - Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC)
  - Adequacy Decisions
  - Binding Corporate Rules (BCR)
- AI systems must ensure model training does not violate data residency regulations.

---

## 10.0 Incident Management & Breach Notification

- All suspected data breaches must:
  - Be reported to the DPO within 12 hours.
  - Trigger a risk assessment.
  - Be notified to supervisory authority within 72 hours if risk is high.
