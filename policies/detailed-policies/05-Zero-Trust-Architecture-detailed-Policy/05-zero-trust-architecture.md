# 05 – Zero Trust Architecture (Detailed Policy)

*Auto-generated by SYREN PolicyGPT*

---

## 1.0 Purpose

To implement a Zero Trust security model within SYREN’s AI-powered infrastructure, ensuring that all access requests—internal or external—are continuously validated based on identity, context, and behavior.

---

## 2.0 Scope

This policy applies to:
- All endpoints, users, APIs, SaaS tools, cloud workloads, and AI model interfaces within SYREN.
- All environments: development, staging, and production.
- Third-party and federated access.

---

## 3.0 Core Principles

- **Never Trust, Always Verify**: All requests must be authenticated and authorized, regardless of origin.
- **Least Privilege Access**: Users and services get only the minimum access required.
- **Microsegmentation**: Isolate workloads to limit lateral movement.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: All sessions are monitored in real-time using AI analytics.
- **Context-Aware Access**: Access is granted based on user role, location, device, and behavioral signals.

## 4.0 Architecture Components

| Component              | Function                                                              |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Identity Provider (IdP)| Authenticates user/service identities via SSO and MFA                 |
| Policy Decision Point (PDP) | Evaluates access context and risk score                      |
| Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) | Enforces access control at the data or app level           |
| Security Data Lake     | Stores audit logs and telemetry for risk detection                   |
| Microsegmentation Gateway | Enforces per-application or per-model communication boundaries |

---

## 5.0 Authentication and Authorization

- Mandatory MFA for all users and admin accounts
- Risk-based conditional access (e.g., geo-location, time-of-day rules)
- Token expiration limits and rotation (OAuth 2.0/JWT)
- Non-human access requires signed service tokens or mTLS

---

## 6.0 AI-Driven Access Scoring

- UEBA (User and Entity Behavior Analytics) continuously profiles users
- Risk score triggers:
  - Session quarantine
  - Step-up authentication
  - Temporary access suspension

Example:
- A developer accessing production from a new location → High-risk score → MFA challenge

## 7.0 Microsegmentation Policy

| Zone                   | Description                               | Controls                       |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| User/Dev Zone          | Workstations, SaaS portals                | Internet access restricted     |
| Data Zone              | Databases, model storage                  | Encrypted, restricted          |
| App Zone               | APIs, ML inference servers                | WAF + mTLS + IP allowlists     |
| Control Zone           | CI/CD, SIEM, log servers                  | Jump box + MFA-only            |

---

## 8.0 Monitoring and Response

- All access logs are centralized and fed into an AI-driven SIEM
- Anomaly detection:
  - High-volume API calls
  - Irregular access hours
  - Geo-jumps
- Automated responses:
  - Alert SOC team
  - Revoke token/session
  - Enforce policy revalidation

---

## 9.0 Zero Trust for SaaS & APIs

- SaaS services must support:
  - SCIM for identity lifecycle integration
  - RBAC with audit trails
  - Geo-fencing and IP filtering
- APIs must:
  - Use API Gateways with rate-limiting
  - Enforce OAuth2 + TLS 1.3
  - Log and encrypt all requests and responses

---

## 10.0 Roles and Responsibilities

| Role               | Responsibilities                                               |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Security Architect | Designs and maintains Zero Trust policies and segmentation    |
| DevOps Engineers   | Enforces access rules in infrastructure and CI/CD              |
| AI Engineers       | Ensure secure APIs for models and inference layers             |
| SOC Team           | Monitors Zero Trust logs and triggers incident response       |
| CISO               | Approves trust boundaries and security exceptions              |

---

## 11.0 Compliance Alignment

| Standard            | Reference                                       |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| NIST SP 800-207     | Zero Trust Architecture                        |
| ISO/IEC 27001       | A.13 – Network Security, A.9 – Access Control  |
| CIS Controls v8     | Control 14 (Network Segmentation), 6, 16       |

## 12.0 Review Cycle

- **Owner**: Security Architect
- **Last Reviewed**: April 2025
- **Next Review**: April 2026 or after any Zero Trust framework update
- **Frequency**: Annual or upon significant architectural change

---

*Zero Trust is a continuous commitment—not a one-time deployment. This policy defines how SYREN ensures security without assuming trust across any surface.*
