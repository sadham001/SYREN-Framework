# 09 – AI Model Lifecycle Management (Detailed Policy)

*Auto-generated by SYREN PolicyGPT*

---

## 1.0 Purpose

This policy outlines the procedures and standards for the management of the entire lifecycle of AI models used within the SYREN cybersecurity framework. It aims to ensure that AI models are developed, deployed, monitored, and retired in a secure, efficient, and compliant manner.

---

## 2.0 Scope

This policy applies to:
- All AI models used in SYREN’s systems and services, from inception to decommission.
- All teams and stakeholders involved in the development, deployment, operation, and retirement of AI models, including data scientists, developers, and security teams.

## 3.0 AI Model Lifecycle Phases

### 3.1 Phase 1: Development and Design
- **AI Model Design**: The design phase should align with SYREN’s cybersecurity objectives and ethical guidelines. This includes defining the model’s purpose, objectives, and scope.
- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Data used to train the AI model must be sourced from secure, reliable, and diverse datasets. The data should be cleaned, anonymized (if applicable), and preprocessed for bias minimization and quality assurance.
- **Algorithm Selection**: The AI algorithm should be selected based on the model’s use case, ensuring that it provides an appropriate balance between performance, fairness, and explainability.
- **Security and Privacy Considerations**: Security risks related to the data and model should be identified and mitigated during this phase. Any personal data used for training must be handled in compliance with privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

### 3.2 Phase 2: Training and Testing
- **Model Training**: AI models should be trained using secure and validated environments. The training data must be comprehensive and representative of real-world scenarios to minimize bias.
- **Validation and Testing**: Models should undergo rigorous validation and testing, including performance testing, fairness testing, and stress testing. Any identified issues must be addressed before deployment.
- **Explainability and Transparency**: The AI model should include explainable components to ensure that the decision-making process is transparent and understandable to stakeholders.
- **Security Testing**: The model must undergo security testing to ensure that it is resistant to adversarial attacks and data manipulation.

### 3.3 Phase 3: Deployment and Monitoring
- **Deployment Planning**: The deployment of AI models should be carefully planned, with a clear strategy for integration into existing systems and processes.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring should be implemented to assess the model’s performance, detect anomalies, and track any issues that arise post-deployment.
- **Model Drift Management**: AI models must be regularly evaluated to detect model drift, where the model’s performance degrades over time due to changes in the input data or environment. Appropriate adjustments should be made as necessary.
- **Incident Response**: In case of model failures or breaches, an incident response plan should be executed, including identifying the cause, mitigating risks, and restoring normal operations.

### 3.4 Phase 4: Retirement and Decommissioning
- **Model Evaluation**: Before decommissioning, a final evaluation of the model should be performed to assess its impact, effectiveness, and any residual risks.
- **Data Disposal**: All data associated with the model, including training data and results, should be securely deleted to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Model Decommissioning**: The AI model should be formally retired, with all related resources, including servers and environments, removed or repurposed.
- **Post-Retirement Audit**: A post-retirement audit should be conducted to ensure that the model is fully removed from production systems and that no residual data remains accessible.

## 4.0 Security and Compliance Requirements

### 4.1 Security Requirements
- **Secure Environment**: AI models should be developed and deployed in secure, isolated environments that prevent unauthorized access to model data and training data.
- **Adversarial Attack Mitigation**: Measures should be taken to prevent adversarial attacks, including robust training and validation procedures.
- **Data Security**: Any sensitive data used in training or testing should be encrypted, anonymized, and processed according to privacy regulations.

### 4.2 Compliance with Regulations
- **Regulatory Compliance**: All AI models must comply with relevant data protection regulations, such as GDPR, CCPA, or other applicable laws.
- **Model Transparency**: AI models must be transparent and explainable in their decision-making processes to comply with transparency regulations.
- **Auditability**: AI models must maintain audit trails of their decision-making and data usage, enabling auditing by internal and external parties.

## 6.0 Risk Management and Incident Response

### 6.1 Risk Management
- **Risk Assessment**: Before model deployment, a thorough risk assessment should be conducted, focusing on potential risks related to data security, model performance, and regulatory compliance.
- **Risk Mitigation**: Identified risks should be mitigated through appropriate design, testing, monitoring, and decommissioning strategies.

### 6.2 Incident Response
- **Incident Reporting**: Any security incidents or model failures should be immediately reported to the Incident Response Team.
- **Post-Incident Analysis**: After an incident, a root cause analysis should be conducted to determine how the issue occurred and prevent future occurrences.
