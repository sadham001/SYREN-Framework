# 06 - Escalation Process

*Auto-generated by SYREN PolicyGPT*

## 1.0 Overview

The escalation process outlines the steps that must be followed when identifying, reporting, and resolving AI-related incidents, anomalies, or compliance breaches within the **Governance and Accountability** framework. The process ensures that issues are swiftly escalated to the appropriate personnel or teams for resolution and that risks are mitigated in a timely and controlled manner. This policy ensures accountability and traceability throughout the escalation process, minimizing the potential impact of AI-related incidents on the organization's security posture and compliance status.

---

## 2.0 Incident Identification

The first step in the escalation process is the identification of an incident, anomaly, or compliance breach. Incidents can be detected through various means, including but not limited to:

- Anomalies in AI model outputs that indicate possible bias or errors.
- Security breaches such as unauthorized access to AI models or training data.
- Compliance failures, including violations of regulatory standards like GDPR, ISO 27001, or NIST 800-53.
- Performance degradation or operational failure in AI models.

Once an incident is identified, it is crucial that it is immediately documented and logged into the **AI Incident Register**.

---

## 3.0 Initial Incident Logging

**3.1 Incident Logging Procedure:**
- All identified incidents must be recorded in the **AI Incident Register** within one hour of discovery.
- The following information must be captured:
  - **Incident ID:** A unique identifier for the incident.
  - **Date & Time:** When the incident was identified.
  - **Type of Incident:** Categorize the issue (e.g., security breach, compliance failure, performance degradation).
  - **Description:** A brief description of the issue, including affected systems or models.
  - **Initial Severity Rating:** Preliminary classification of the issue (e.g., Low, Medium, High, Critical).
  - **Responsible Team:** The team or individual responsible for investigating and resolving the incident.

---

## 4.0 Incident Assessment and Categorization

Once an incident is logged, the next step is to assess and categorize the severity of the issue. This is done by the **AI Risk Manager (ARMO)** in collaboration with the **Chief AI Risk Officer (CAIRO)**. The categorization will determine the urgency and the appropriate escalation steps.

### 4.1 Severity Levels

The incident severity is categorized into four levels:

- **Low:** Minor issues with limited impact on operations. These issues can be addressed within normal operating procedures and timelines.
- **Medium:** Issues that affect performance or compliance but do not pose an immediate risk. These issues should be prioritized and resolved within 24-48 hours.
- **High:** Significant issues that may lead to regulatory breaches, data loss, or performance failure. Immediate action is required, and resolution should be pursued within 12 hours.
- **Critical:** Severe incidents that pose an imminent threat to the integrity of AI models, data, or the security framework. These incidents must be addressed immediately (within 1-2 hours) and reported directly to the **AI Oversight Board (AIOB)**.

## 5.0 Escalation Process

### 5.1 Initial Escalation (Within 1 Hour)

- **Low Severity:** Issues classified as low severity should be addressed by the **responsible team** (e.g., AI Engineers, Data Stewards). The incident will be resolved within normal procedures, and the **AI Incident Register** should be updated with resolution notes.
  
- **Medium Severity:** Medium severity incidents require the **AI Risk Manager (ARMO)** to oversee the investigation. The responsible team must report the status to the **Chief AI Risk Officer (CAIRO)** within 24 hours for review.

- **High Severity:** High severity issues trigger an immediate escalation to the **CAIRO**. The **CAIRO** will assess the situation and escalate it to the **AI Oversight Board (AIOB)** if necessary, within 12 hours. The **AIOB** may involve external experts or legal teams for assistance.

- **Critical Severity:** Critical issues are immediately escalated to the **AIOB** and involve the **Executive Board**. The issue must be resolved within hours, and an **Incident Response Plan** (IRP) is activated. All related parties, including external cybersecurity experts, compliance officers, and legal teams, will be mobilized to address the breach.

---

### 5.2 Secondary Escalation (Within 12 Hours for High/ Critical)

- **High Severity Incident:** After the **CAIRO** has assessed and acknowledged a high severity issue, the **CAIRO** must notify the **AIOB**. If a breach is suspected, the **Legal & Compliance** team will be involved, and an internal investigation will be launched immediately. External regulatory bodies may be notified as required, within the specified timeframes.
  
- **Critical Severity Incident:** For critical issues, the **AIOB** may convene an emergency meeting to discuss the next steps. This meeting should occur within 1-2 hours of the incident being classified as critical. All action steps, including risk containment, public notifications (if required), and resolution timelines, will be outlined in this meeting.

---

## 6.0 Incident Resolution and Documentation

Once an incident has been resolved, the following steps must be taken:

1. **Root Cause Analysis:** A thorough investigation must be performed to identify the root cause of the incident. This report will be submitted to the **AI Oversight Board (AIOB)** and must include preventive measures to avoid recurrence.
   
2. **Post-Incident Review:** A post-mortem report will be generated by the **AI Risk Manager (ARMO)**. This report will detail the incident, the steps taken to mitigate it, and the outcomes. The **CAIRO** will review the report and propose any necessary policy or procedural changes.

3. **Update the AI Incident Register:** All actions taken during the escalation process must be documented in the **AI Incident Register**, including the incident's final resolution and root cause analysis. The **AI Risk Register** must also be updated accordingly.

---

## 7.0 Training and Awareness

To ensure that the escalation process is effective, all relevant personnel must be trained on the incident identification, logging, and escalation procedures. Regular drills and training sessions will be conducted by the **AI Risk Manager (ARMO)** to familiarize teams with the process.

- **Annual Training:** All employees must complete annual training on the escalation process, with specific focus on their roles in identifying and reporting incidents.
  
- **Simulated Escalation Drills:** Regular simulated incidents will be conducted to test the readiness of the teams and to refine the escalation process.

---

## 8.0 Monitoring and Continuous Improvement

The escalation process is not static; it will evolve based on feedback and lessons learned from previous incidents. The **AI Oversight Board (AIOB)** will periodically review and update the escalation protocols as part of a continuous improvement strategy.

- **Escalation Audit:** A quarterly audit will be performed to assess the efficiency of the escalation process. Any gaps or inefficiencies identified will be addressed in the following quarter.
  
- **Metrics and KPIs:** Key performance indicators (KPIs) will be tracked to assess the performance of the escalation process. These KPIs include response time, resolution time, and the number of incidents that are successfully managed without escalation to critical levels.
