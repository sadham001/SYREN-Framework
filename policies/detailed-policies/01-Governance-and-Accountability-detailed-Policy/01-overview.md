## 1.0 Introduction

Governance and accountability in AI and cybersecurity operations ensure that decisions, responsibilities, and oversight mechanisms are defined and enforced across all teams. This document elaborates on the high-level policy by providing implementation-level guidance and structure.

## 2.0 Governance Framework

### 2.1 AI Oversight Board (AIOB)

- Composed of internal experts from security, compliance, legal, and AI engineering teams.
- Responsibilities:
  - Define AI ethical guidelines and compliance standards.
  - Approve or reject AI models for deployment.
  - Review audit logs quarterly.

### 2.2 Chief AI Risk Officer (CAIRO)

- Reports to CTO and CISO.
- Maintains the AI Risk Register.
- Coordinates investigations into anomalies flagged by AI models.

### 2.3 Policy Manager

- Ensures all AI policies align with frameworks such as ISO 27001, NIST 800-53, and GDPR.
- Works with internal and external auditors during compliance reviews.
