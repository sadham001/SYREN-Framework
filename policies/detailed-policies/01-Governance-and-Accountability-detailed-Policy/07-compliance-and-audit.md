## 1.0 Overview

Compliance and auditing are crucial aspects of the Governance and Accountability framework for AI and cybersecurity operations. This policy ensures that AI models, systems, and operations comply with all relevant laws, regulations, and internal standards. It also outlines the processes for regular audits to evaluate the effectiveness of AI governance and accountability measures. The goal is to minimize risks associated with AI deployment and ensure adherence to ethical, legal, and security standards.

This section discusses the approach to compliance, auditing processes, responsibilities, and the mechanisms in place to ensure continuous monitoring and adherence to policy standards.

## 2.0 Compliance Requirements

The AI governance framework must comply with various global standards and regulations. These requirements define the legal and ethical boundaries within which AI models must operate, ensuring that AI systems do not cause harm or violate rights.

### 2.1 Key Regulations and Standards

- **ISO 27001:** Ensures the protection of information security and management.
- **NIST 800-53:** Provides a comprehensive set of controls for information security systems, including AI models.
- **GDPR:** Sets out guidelines for data protection and privacy, specifically concerning personal data processing by AI systems.
- **AI Ethics Guidelines:** Specifies ethical considerations for AI development, deployment, and monitoring, such as transparency, fairness, and accountability.

### 2.2 Compliance Obligations

- **Data Protection Compliance:** AI systems must comply with data protection laws such as GDPR, including ensuring personal data is collected, stored, and processed with consent and security.
- **Security Compliance:** AI models must be designed and operated in compliance with ISO 27001 and NIST 800-53 standards, which set requirements for data integrity, confidentiality, and system security.
- **Ethical Compliance:** AI systems must align with ethical guidelines defined by the organization and external advisory bodies. Compliance will also include fairness, transparency, and accountability in decision-making processes.

## 3.0 Audit Program

### 3.1 Internal Audits

Regular internal audits are essential for ensuring that AI systems and operations align with compliance requirements and that governance policies are being followed. Internal audits will focus on:

- Reviewing AI model documentation and version control to ensure compliance with approved standards.
- Evaluating the effectiveness of risk management practices in identifying and mitigating AI-related risks.
- Assessing the compliance of data protection measures, including consent management, data storage, and privacy controls.
- Verifying the adequacy and timeliness of staff training on AI ethics and compliance requirements.

### 3.2 External Audits

External audits provide an independent review of the organization's compliance with AI governance policies and regulatory requirements. These audits will be conducted by third-party auditors with expertise in AI and cybersecurity standards. External audits will focus on:

- Verifying the organization’s adherence to external standards such as ISO 27001, NIST 800-53, and GDPR.
- Assessing AI systems for fairness, transparency, and accountability in line with ethical guidelines.
- Reviewing the adequacy of AI risk assessments and the organization’s incident response plan.
- Evaluating the security and integrity of AI systems, models, and data.

External audits will be conducted at least annually or following significant changes in AI operations or regulatory requirements.

The following roles are responsible for overseeing compliance and audit activities within the organization:

### 4.1 AI Oversight Board (AIOB)

- Approves and monitors the audit strategy and schedule.
- Reviews audit reports and ensures corrective actions are taken when non-compliance is identified.
- Coordinates with external auditors and provides necessary documentation and resources for audits.

### 4.2 Chief AI Risk Officer (CAIRO)

- Oversees the execution of internal and external audits related to AI governance and compliance.
- Ensures that corrective actions are implemented following audit findings.
- Maintains a record of all audit reports and tracks compliance status.

### 4.3 Legal & Compliance Team

- Provides guidance on regulatory and legal compliance requirements.
- Ensures that AI models, systems, and processes comply with data protection laws, cybersecurity standards, and ethical guidelines.
- Coordinates with internal and external auditors to provide the necessary legal documentation and support during audits.

### 4.4 Internal Audit Team

- Conducts regular internal audits to assess the organization’s compliance with AI governance policies.
- Identifies risks and vulnerabilities related to AI operations and ensures mitigation measures are in place.
- Prepares audit reports and submits them to the AI Oversight Board for review.

## 5.0 Audit Process

The audit process is structured to ensure that compliance and governance measures are continuously assessed and improved. The steps include:

### 5.1 Planning and Preparation

- **Audit Scope:** The scope of the audit is defined, focusing on AI systems, data protection measures, ethical guidelines, and compliance with regulatory standards.
- **Audit Schedule:** The audit schedule is developed by the **AI Oversight Board (AIOB)** and includes both internal and external audits, with specific timeframes for each.
- **Resource Allocation:** Necessary resources, including personnel, tools, and documentation, are prepared to support the audit process.

### 5.2 Execution

- **Audit Team Formation:** An audit team is formed, consisting of internal auditors, compliance officers, and legal advisors. The team works with external auditors if applicable.
- **Data Collection:** The audit team collects relevant documentation, records, and data for review. This includes reviewing AI model logs, version control, compliance reports, and incident logs.
- **Interviews and Reviews:** Interviews with key personnel, including AI engineers, data stewards, and compliance officers, are conducted to assess understanding and adherence to policies.

### 5.3 Reporting

- **Audit Findings:** The audit team documents the findings, including compliance gaps, risks, and areas for improvement. Each finding is categorized by severity (e.g., low, medium, high).
- **Corrective Actions:** The audit report includes recommendations for corrective actions to address identified issues. The **AI Oversight Board (AIOB)** reviews these recommendations and prioritizes actions based on the severity of the findings.

### 5.4 Follow-Up and Resolution

- **Action Plan:** The **CAIRO** works with relevant teams to develop an action plan for addressing audit findings.
- **Implementation:** Corrective actions are implemented according to the action plan, with regular status updates provided to the **AI Oversight Board (AIOB)**.
- **Verification:** The **Internal Audit Team** conducts follow-up audits to verify that corrective actions have been implemented successfully.

## 6.0 Continuous Monitoring

In addition to periodic audits, continuous monitoring of AI systems is essential to ensure ongoing compliance with policies and regulatory requirements. This involves:

- **Automated Compliance Monitoring Tools:** Utilizing tools to automatically monitor and flag non-compliance in AI models, data handling, and operations.
- **Real-Time Alerts:** Setting up real-time alerts for any breach of compliance or operational standards, allowing for quick intervention.
- **Ongoing Risk Assessments:** Regularly conducting risk assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities in AI systems and their compliance with security standards.
