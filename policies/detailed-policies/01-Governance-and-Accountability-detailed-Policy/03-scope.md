## 1.0 Introduction

The **Scope** section defines the boundaries within which the governance and accountability policy will apply. It clarifies the specific teams, processes, technologies, and systems involved in the management and oversight of AI models and systems. The scope of this policy applies across all activities where AI technologies are developed, deployed, and maintained, ensuring governance at every stage.

## 2.0 Policy Scope

The governance and accountability policy is applicable to the following:

### 2.1 Teams and Stakeholders
- **Internal Teams:**
  - AI Engineering: Responsible for designing, developing, and testing AI systems.
  - Data Science: Focused on creating data models and ensuring the quality of data used in AI systems.
  - IT Security: Ensures secure deployment and operation of AI systems, including threat detection and incident response.
  - Legal & Compliance: Manages regulatory compliance, ensuring adherence to laws like GDPR, HIPAA, and others.
  - Risk Management: Assesses potential risks associated with AI deployments and suggests mitigation strategies.

- **External Stakeholders:**
  - **Third-party Vendors:** Providers of external services or models integrated into the AI system.
  - **Regulatory Authorities:** Government bodies and organizations setting and enforcing regulations and compliance standards.

### 2.2 Technologies and Systems Covered
- **AI Models:** The governance and accountability policy applies to all AI models being developed, trained, tested, and deployed within the organization.
- **Data Sources:** Data utilized for AI system training, model validation, and ongoing optimization.
- **Tools & Infrastructure:** Tools used for model development, data management, testing, and monitoring.
- **Deployment Platforms:** AI systems deployed on internal or third-party cloud infrastructure, servers, or edge devices.

### 2.3 Activities Covered
- **Development**: Creation of new AI models, including training, fine-tuning, and testing.
- **Deployment**: Deployment of AI models to production environments.
- **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Ongoing surveillance of AI models for performance, security, and regulatory compliance.
- **Ethical Review and Auditing**: Ensuring that AI models are evaluated for fairness, transparency, and accountability.
- **Incident Response**: Addressing any failures, breaches, or deviations from the established governance framework.

## 3.0 Exclusions

The following activities and systems are **not** covered by this governance policy:

- **Non-AI Systems:** This policy does not apply to non-AI-based systems used for internal operations (e.g., traditional IT infrastructure, manual processes).
- **Research Systems:** Systems developed solely for academic or research purposes, and not intended for production or deployment.
- **Third-Party AI Models:** While third-party models used in production systems may be subject to review, their development and governance are outside the scope of this policy.
