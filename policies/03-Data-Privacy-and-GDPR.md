## 1. Purpose
This policy outlines the data privacy principles and compliance requirements for AI systems within the SYREN cybersecurity framework. It ensures that data is handled securely, privately, and in compliance with global data protection laws, including GDPR.

## 2. Scope
This policy applies to all data handled by SYREN's AI systems, including data collected, stored, processed, or transmitted in relation to threat detection, monitoring, and response. The policy applies to both personal data and non-personal data processed within SYREN’s infrastructure, including cloud, on-premise, and hybrid environments.

## 3. Data Privacy Principles
SYREN upholds the following principles in managing data privacy:

- **Data Minimization**: Only collect and process the data necessary for the specified purpose.
- **Purpose Limitation**: Data will be collected and processed only for specific, legitimate purposes.
- **Accuracy**: Ensure data is accurate, complete, and kept up to date.
- **Storage Limitation**: Retain data only for as long as necessary to fulfill its purpose.
- **Integrity and Confidentiality**: Protect data against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
- **Transparency**: Clearly inform data subjects about how their data will be used, stored, and processed.

## 4. Data Collection and Processing
SYREN AI systems collect and process data in accordance with the following guidelines:

- **Personal Data**: Personal data such as IP addresses, device IDs, and user identifiers are only collected where necessary for threat detection and mitigation. This data will not be used for any other purpose.
- **Data Sources**: Data is collected from logs, network traffic, system events, and external threat intelligence sources.
- **Processing Activities**: Data is processed through AI models to detect anomalies, identify threats, and generate risk assessments.

## 5. Data Subject Rights
In compliance with GDPR and other data protection laws, data subjects have the following rights:

- **Right to Access**: Data subjects can request access to their personal data.
- **Right to Rectification**: Data subjects can request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data.
- **Right to Erasure**: Data subjects can request the deletion of their personal data in certain circumstances.
- **Right to Restriction of Processing**: Data subjects can request restrictions on the processing of their personal data.
- **Right to Data Portability**: Data subjects can request the transfer of their personal data to another service provider in a structured, commonly used format.
- **Right to Object**: Data subjects can object to the processing of their personal data for specific purposes, such as profiling or marketing.

## 6. GDPR Compliance
SYREN’s AI systems are fully compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and adhere to the following principles:

- **Consent**: Where required, obtain explicit consent from data subjects before processing their personal data.
- **Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)**: Conduct DPIAs for high-risk processing activities to evaluate and mitigate risks to data subjects' privacy.
- **Data Breach Notification**: In case of a data breach, SYREN will notify the relevant supervisory authority within 72 hours, and inform affected data subjects when necessary.

## 7. Data Security Measures
SYREN implements the following data security measures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of personal data:

- **Encryption**: All personal data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
- **Access Controls**: Access to personal data is restricted to authorized personnel only.
- **Anonymization and Pseudonymization**: Where possible, personal data is anonymized or pseudonymized to minimize privacy risks.
- **Security Audits**: Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments are conducted to identify and address potential threats.
