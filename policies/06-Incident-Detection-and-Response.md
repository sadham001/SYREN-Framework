# 06 - Incident Detection and Response Policy

*Auto-generated by SYREN PolicyGPT*

## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to define the processes and protocols for detecting, responding to, and mitigating cybersecurity incidents within SYREN’s infrastructure. This policy ensures that AI-driven systems are continuously monitored for security breaches and that effective response strategies are in place to protect organizational assets.

## 2. Scope
This policy applies to all AI-driven systems, network assets, users, and services within SYREN’s environment, including cloud, on-premise, and hybrid infrastructures. It covers incidents related to unauthorized access, data breaches, AI system failures, and other cybersecurity threats.

## 3. Incident Detection Principles
SYREN follows these key principles to detect and respond to security incidents:

- **Proactive Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of AI systems, networks, and endpoints for any anomalies or suspicious activities using AI-driven threat detection tools.
- **Behavioral Analytics**: AI systems analyze user behavior and network traffic patterns to identify deviations from normal behavior, indicating potential threats.
- **Real-time Alerts**: Automated alerts are generated whenever suspicious activities are detected, ensuring immediate attention from the Security Operations Center (SOC).
- **Automated Detection**: Integration of AI-based systems for real-time detection of threats such as malware, unauthorized access attempts, and other cyberattacks.

## 4. Incident Classification
Incidents are classified based on their severity and impact, as follows:

- **Critical Incidents**: Major security breaches, data exfiltration, or AI model manipulation. These incidents require immediate containment, investigation, and remediation.
- **High Incidents**: Significant unauthorized access attempts, failed authentication, or data integrity issues. These require quick mitigation and investigation.
- **Medium Incidents**: Suspicious activities, minor policy violations, or system irregularities. These require monitoring and assessment for future risks.
- **Low Incidents**: Non-threatening alerts or minor deviations from expected behavior. These incidents are logged for later review and trend analysis.

## 5. Incident Response Strategy
Once an incident is detected, SYREN follows a structured response plan to ensure that risks are mitigated promptly:

- **Containment**: Immediately isolate the affected systems, devices, or users to prevent further damage or escalation. This includes revoking access or quarantining compromised resources.
- **Investigation**: The SOC and AI-driven systems analyze the incident’s cause, scope, and potential impact. Logs and system data are reviewed to understand the extent of the threat.
- **Eradication**: Once the cause is identified, any malicious software or unauthorized access vectors are removed, and the affected systems are secured.
- **Recovery**: Affected systems are restored to normal operation, and any compromised data is either recovered or securely discarded.
- **Lessons Learned**: After the incident is resolved, a post-incident review is conducted to identify weaknesses in the system or response process. Actionable insights are incorporated into future incident detection and response plans.

## 6. Incident Response Team (IRT)
SYREN’s Incident Response Team consists of the following roles:

| Role                        | Responsibility                                                               |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Incident Response Lead      | Coordinates the overall response efforts and communicates with management.   |
| Security Analysts           | Investigate the incident, analyze logs, and determine the cause and impact. |
| Forensics Team              | Performs in-depth analysis and recovery of affected systems and data.       |
| Legal & Compliance Team     | Ensures that all regulatory and compliance requirements are met during the response. |
| Communications Lead         | Manages communication with external stakeholders, including regulators and customers. |

## 7. AI-Driven Incident Detection Tools
SYREN utilizes the following AI-driven tools to detect and respond to incidents:

- **AI-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Monitors network traffic for signs of intrusion and generates real-time alerts.
- **Behavioral Analytics Engines**: Identifies anomalies in user behavior, AI model activity, and system performance.
- **AI Security Orchestration and Automation (SOAR)**: Automates response actions, such as isolating compromised devices or notifying the response team, based on predefined security rules.

## 8. Reporting and Documentation
- **Incident Reports**: Detailed reports are generated for each incident, documenting the detection, response, and resolution processes. These reports are reviewed by the management team and used for continuous improvement.
- **Compliance Documentation**: Incident reports are maintained in accordance with relevant compliance standards (e.g., GDPR, ISO 27001). These reports are available for audit and regulatory review.

## 9. Continuous Improvement
- **Post-Incident Analysis**: After each incident, the Incident Response Team conducts a retrospective analysis to identify areas for improvement in detection, response, and prevention.
- **Training and Awareness**: Regular training is provided to all team members on incident detection and response procedures. AI-driven simulations are conducted to test and refine response strategies.
- **Policy Updates**: The Incident Detection and Response Policy is reviewed annually or after major incidents to ensure it aligns with current threat landscapes and best practices.

## 10. Compliance and Audit
SYREN’s Incident Detection and Response policy aligns with several international standards and regulations:

| Control Area               | ISO 27001   | NIST 800-53   | GDPR           |
|----------------------------|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| Incident Detection          | A.16.1.2    | IR-4          | Art. 33        |
| Incident Response           | A.16.1.5    | IR-6          | Art. 33        |
| Logging and Monitoring      | A.12.4.1    | SI-4          | Art. 33        |
| Post-Incident Review        | A.16.1.7    | IR-5          | Art. 33        |

## 11. Review Cycle
- **Owner**: Incident Response Lead
- **Review Frequency**: Annually or after any significant cybersecurity incident or regulatory change.
