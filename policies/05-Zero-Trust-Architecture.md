# 05 - Zero Trust Architecture Policy

*Auto-generated by SYREN PolicyGPT*

## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to establish the principles and guidelines for implementing a Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) within SYREN’s cybersecurity framework. This policy ensures that all users, devices, and systems are subject to continuous verification and validation before being granted access to resources, regardless of their location within or outside the network perimeter.

## 2. Scope
This policy applies to all users, systems, devices, and applications within SYREN’s environment, including on-premise, cloud, and hybrid infrastructures. It covers access to critical systems, sensitive data, and AI models across SYREN’s network.

## 3. Zero Trust Principles
SYREN follows the following core principles of Zero Trust Architecture:

- **Never Trust, Always Verify**: Access to resources is based on continuous verification of identity, device health, and context, rather than assuming trust based on network location.
- **Least Privilege Access**: Users and systems are granted only the minimal level of access required to perform specific tasks, and permissions are reviewed regularly.
- **Micro-Segmentation**: The network is segmented into smaller, isolated zones to reduce the attack surface and limit lateral movement of threats.
- **Explicit Access Control**: Access decisions are made based on a set of predefined security policies, including user role, device health, and risk profile.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Activities and behaviors across the network are continuously monitored, with real-time analysis to detect and respond to anomalies.

## 4. Zero Trust Implementation Strategy
To implement Zero Trust across the organization, SYREN follows a multi-step approach:

- **User Authentication and Authorization**: All users must authenticate using multi-factor authentication (MFA) before being granted access to systems. Role-based access control (RBAC) is used to enforce least privilege and limit access to sensitive resources.
- **Device Security**: Devices accessing the network must meet certain security standards (e.g., antivirus, encryption) and be continuously monitored for compliance. Devices that do not meet these standards are denied access.
- **Network Segmentation**: The network is divided into segmented zones, each with its own access control policies. Access between these segments is tightly controlled and monitored.
- **AI-based Behavioral Analytics**: AI-driven systems continuously monitor user behavior and network traffic to identify potential threats, such as unusual login times or access patterns.
- **Automated Response and Remediation**: When suspicious activities are detected, automated systems can isolate affected devices, block access, or trigger alerts for further investigation.

## 5. Access Control for AI Models and Data
Within a Zero Trust framework, access to AI models and sensitive data is controlled through the following:

- **AI Model Access Control**: Only authorized personnel with specific roles have access to train, modify, or deploy AI models. AI model access is restricted based on the principle of least privilege.
- **Data Access Control**: Access to training data, especially sensitive data (e.g., personally identifiable information, classified data), is tightly controlled through encryption and access policies. Data access is also limited by user roles and ongoing risk assessments.
- **AI Model Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of AI models for unusual behavior or unauthorized access attempts is enforced using AI-based monitoring tools.

## 6. Incident Response and Threat Mitigation
In the event of a security incident, SYREN’s Zero Trust policies ensure the following:

- **Containment**: Suspicious devices or users are immediately isolated, and access to sensitive resources is blocked.
- **Investigation**: AI-driven systems generate detailed logs and alerts to facilitate a rapid investigation. Security teams assess and respond to the incident in real time.
- **Remediation**: Once the threat is identified and mitigated, affected systems are restored to their normal state, and policies are reviewed to prevent similar incidents.

## 7. Compliance and Audit
SYREN’s Zero Trust Architecture policy ensures compliance with various international cybersecurity standards and regulations:

| Control Area               | ISO 27001   | NIST 800-53   | GDPR           |
|----------------------------|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| Access Control Framework    | A.9.1.1     | AC-1          | Art. 32        |
| Device Security             | A.9.2.2     | AC-3          | Art. 25        |
| Continuous Monitoring       | A.12.4.1    | SI-4          | Art. 33        |
| Incident Response           | A.16.1.5    | IR-4          | Art. 33        |
| Data Encryption and Access  | A.10.1.1    | SC-12         | Art. 32        |

## 8. Review Cycle
- **Owner**: Zero Trust Implementation Lead
- **Review Frequency**: Annually, or whenever there are significant changes to the Zero Trust model or regulatory requirements.
