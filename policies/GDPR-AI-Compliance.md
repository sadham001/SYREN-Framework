# SYREN GDPR Automation Policy  
*Generated for UAE/EU hybrid deployments*

### **AI-Enabled Compliance**  

1. **Data Mapping**: SYREN auto-discovers PII (Personally Identifiable Information) using NLP (Natural Language Processing) algorithms to identify and classify sensitive data across systems.
  
2. **DSAR Handling**: AI-driven chatbot processes Data Subject Access Requests (DSARs) in less than 24 hours, ensuring compliance with the GDPR's "Right to Access" principle.

3. **Breach Response**: AI predicts breach impact and classifies incidents per Article 33 of GDPR to help automate breach notifications and minimize damage.
